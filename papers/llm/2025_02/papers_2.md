| **[Towards Robust Legal Reasoning: Harnessing Logical LLMs in Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17638v1)**<details>Legal services rely heavily on text processing. While large language models (LLMs) show promise, their application in legal contexts demands higher accuracy, repeatability, and transparency. Logic programs, by encoding legal concepts as structured rules and facts, offer reliable automation, but require sophisticated text extraction. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that integrates LLMs' natural language understanding with logic-based reasoning to address these limitations. As a legal document case study, we applied neuro-symbolic AI to coverage-related queries in insurance contracts using both closed and open-source LLMs. While LLMs have improved in legal reasoning, they still lack the accuracy and consistency required for complex contract analysis. In our analysis, we tested three methodologies to evaluate whether a specific claim is covered under a contract: a vanilla LLM, an unguided approach that leverages LLMs to encode both the contract and the claim, and a guided approach that uses a framework for the LLM to encode the contract. We demonstrated the promising capabilities of LLM + Logic in the guided approach.</details> | 2025-02-24 |  |
| **[Craw4LLM: Efficient Web Crawling for LLM Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13347v2)**<details>Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Craw4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Craw4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Craw4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/Craw4LLM.</details> | 2025-02-24 |  |
| **[ELMo-Tune-V2: LLM-Assisted Full-Cycle Auto-Tuning to Optimize LSM-Based Key-Value Stores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17606v1)**<details>Log-Structured Merge-tree-based Key-Value Store (LSM-KVS) is a foundational storage engine serving diverse modern workloads, systems, and applications. To suit varying use cases, LSM-KVS allows a vast configuration space that controls core parameters like compaction, flush, and cache sizes, each consuming a shared pool of CPU, Memory, and Storage resources. Navigating the LSM-KVS configuration space necessitates knowledge of the impact of each configuration on the expected workload and underlying hardware. Beyond expensive and time-intensive human-expert-based tuning, existing LSM-KVS tuning solutions focus on tuning with specific workload expectations while limited to a narrow subset of parameters. This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems. ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS. ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads. Through detailed evaluation using RocksDB under several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14X our YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.</details> | 2025-02-24 |  |
| **[Hallucination Detection in LLMs Using Spectral Features of Attention Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17598v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.</details> | 2025-02-24 | <details>Preprint, under review</details> |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Dialogue Management for Full-Duplex Spoken Dialogue Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14145v2)**<details>Achieving full-duplex communication in spoken dialogue systems (SDS) requires real-time coordination between listening, speaking, and thinking. This paper proposes a semantic voice activity detection (VAD) module as a dialogue manager (DM) to efficiently manage turn-taking in full-duplex SDS. Implemented as a lightweight (0.5B) LLM fine-tuned on full-duplex conversation data, the semantic VAD predicts four control tokens to regulate turn-switching and turn-keeping, distinguishing between intentional and unintentional barge-ins while detecting query completion for handling user pauses and hesitations. By processing input speech in short intervals, the semantic VAD enables real-time decision-making, while the core dialogue engine (CDE) is only activated for response generation, reducing computational overhead. This design allows independent DM optimization without retraining the CDE, balancing interaction accuracy and inference efficiency for scalable, next-generation full-duplex SDS.</details> | 2025-02-24 | <details>In submission to INTERSPEECH 2025</details> |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various natural language tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.</details> | 2025-02-24 |  |
| **[The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM Compression Preserve?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17535v1)**<details>Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.</details> | 2025-02-24 |  |
| **[ConvoyLLM: Dynamic Multi-Lane Convoy Control Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17529v1)**<details>This paper proposes a novel method for multi-lane convoy formation control that uses large language models (LLMs) to tackle coordination challenges in dynamic highway environments. Each connected and autonomous vehicle in the convoy uses a knowledge-driven approach to make real-time adaptive decisions based on various scenarios. Our method enables vehicles to dynamically perform tasks, including obstacle avoidance, convoy joining/leaving, and escort formation switching, all while maintaining the overall convoy structure. We design a Interlaced formation control strategy based on locally dynamic distributed graphs, ensuring the convoy remains stable and flexible. We conduct extensive experiments in the SUMO simulation platform across multiple traffic scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, robust, and adaptable to dynamic environments. The code is available at: https://github.com/chuduanfeng/ConvoyLLM.</details> | 2025-02-24 |  |
| **[SQLong: Enhanced NL2SQL for Longer Contexts with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16747v1)**<details>Open-weight large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance in the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task. However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[Next-Generation Database Interfaces: A Survey of LLM-based Text-to-SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08426v4)**<details>Generating accurate SQL from users' natural language questions (text-to-SQL) remains a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restricts the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. Subsequently, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we make a summarization and discuss the remaining challenges in this field and suggest expectations for future research directions.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[RapidPen: Fully Automated IP-to-Shell Penetration Testing with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16730v1)**<details>We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05374v2)**<details>The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Smooth.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[Dynamic LLM Routing and Selection based on User Preferences: Balancing Performance, Cost, and Ethics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16696v1)**<details>With the widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4, BART, and LLaMA, the need for a system that can intelligently select the most suitable model for specific tasks while balancing cost, latency, accuracy, and ethical considerations has become increasingly important. Recognizing that not all tasks necessitate models with over 100 billion parameters, we introduce OptiRoute, an advanced model routing engine designed to dynamically select and route tasks to the optimal LLM based on detailed user-defined requirements. OptiRoute captures both functional (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost) and non-functional (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) criteria, leveraging lightweight task analysis and complexity estimation to efficiently match tasks with the best-fit models from a diverse array of LLMs. By employing a hybrid approach combining k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search and hierarchical filtering, OptiRoute optimizes for user priorities while minimizing computational overhead. This makes it ideal for real-time applications in cloud-based ML platforms, personalized AI services, and regulated industries.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[From Text to Space: Mapping Abstract Spatial Models in LLMs during a Grid-World Navigation Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16690v1)**<details>Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent and reason about spatial information is crucial for building robust agentic systems that can navigate real and simulated environments. In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs process spatial information and provides valuable insights for developing more interpretable and robust agentic AI systems.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138v4)**<details>Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

| **[Are the Values of LLMs Structurally Aligned with Humans? A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00581v2)**<details>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[Reasoning about Affordances: Causal and Compositional Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16606v1)**<details>With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly important to understand their abilities and limitations. In two experiments, we investigate the causal and compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs and humans in the domain of object affordances, an area traditionally linked to embodied cognition. The tasks, designed from scratch to avoid data contamination, require decision-makers to select unconventional objects to replace a typical tool for a particular purpose, such as using a table tennis racket to dig a hole. In Experiment 1, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, finding that GPT-4o, when given chain-of-thought prompting, performed on par with human participants, while GPT-3.5 lagged significantly. In Experiment 2, we introduced two new conditions, Distractor (more object choices, increasing difficulty) and Image (object options presented visually), and evaluated Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in addition to the GPT models. The Distractor condition significantly impaired performance across humans and models, although GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 still performed well above chance. Surprisingly, the Image condition had little impact on humans or GPT-4o, but significantly lowered Claude 3.5's accuracy. Qualitative analysis showed that GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 have a stronger ability than their predecessors to identify and flexibly apply causally relevant object properties. The improvement from GPT-3.5 and Claude 3 to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 suggests that models are increasingly capable of causal and compositional reasoning in some domains, although further mechanistic research is necessary to understand how LLMs reason.</details> | 2025-02-23 | <details>21 pages, 7 figures, 3 tab</details> |
| **[Augmenting Black-box LLMs with Medical Textbooks for Biomedical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02233v4)**<details>Large-scale language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating responses based on human instructions. However, their use in the medical field can be challenging due to their lack of specific, in-depth knowledge. In this study, we present a system called LLMs Augmented with Medical Textbooks (LLM-AMT) designed to enhance the proficiency of LLMs in specialized domains. LLM-AMT integrates authoritative medical textbooks into the LLMs' framework using plug-and-play modules. These modules include a Query Augmenter, a Hybrid Textbook Retriever, and a Knowledge Self-Refiner. Together, they incorporate authoritative medical knowledge. Additionally, an LLM Reader aids in contextual understanding. Our experimental results on three medical QA tasks demonstrate that LLMAMT significantly improves response quality, with accuracy gains ranging from 11.6% to 16.6%. Notably, with GPT-4-Turbo as the base model, LLM-AMT outperforms the specialized Med-PaLM 2 model pre-trained on a massive amount of medical corpus by 2-3%. We found that despite being 100x smaller in size, medical textbooks as a retrieval corpus is proven to be a more effective knowledge database than Wikipedia in the medical domain, boosting performance by 7.8%-13.7%.</details> | 2025-02-23 | <details>This version has been accepted and published at EMNLP Findings 2024</details> |
| **[Reasoning About Persuasion: Can LLMs Enable Explainable Propaganda Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16550v1)**<details>There has been significant research on propagandistic content detection across different modalities and languages. However, most studies have primarily focused on detection, with little attention given to explanations justifying the predicted label. This is largely due to the lack of resources that provide explanations alongside annotated labels. To address this issue, we propose a multilingual (i.e., Arabic and English) explanation-enhanced dataset, the first of its kind. Additionally, we introduce an explanation-enhanced LLM for both label detection and rationale-based explanation generation. Our findings indicate that the model performs comparably while also generating explanations. We will make the dataset and experimental resources publicly available for the research community.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15545v4)**<details>Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks. To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[Multilingual != Multicultural: Evaluating Gaps Between Multilingual Capabilities and Cultural Alignment in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16534v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[On Calibration of LLM-based Guard Models for Reliable Content Moderation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10414v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</details> | 2025-02-23 | <details>Accepted to ICLR 2025</details> |
| **[RouteLLM: Learning to Route LLMs with Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18665v4)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[TerEffic: Highly Efficient Ternary LLM Inference on FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16473v1)**<details>Large Language Model (LLM) deployment on edge devices is typically constrained by the need for off-chip memory access, leading to high power consumption and limited throughput. Ternary quantization for LLMs is promising in maintaining model accuracy while reducing memory footprint. However, existing accelerators have not exploited this potential for on-chip inference. We present TerEffic, an FPGA-based accelerator that carefully co-designs memory architecture and computational units to unlock highly efficient LLM inference with fully on-chip execution. Through weight compression, custom computational units, and memory hierarchy optimization, we achieve unprecedented efficiency by eliminating off-chip memory bandwidth bottlenecks. We propose two architectural variants: a fully on-chip design for smaller models and an HBM-assisted design for larger ones. When evaluated on a 370M parameter model with single-batch inference, our on-chip design achieves 12,700 tokens/sec (149 times higher than NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano) with a power efficiency of 467 tokens/sec/W (19 times better than Jetson Orin Nano). The HBM-assisted design provides 521 tokens/sec on a 2.7B parameter model (2 times higher than NVIDIA's A100) with 33W power consumption, achieving a power efficiency of 16 tokens/sec/W (8 times better than A100).</details> | 2025-02-23 |  |
| **[Towards Fully-Automated Materials Discovery via Large-Scale Synthesis Dataset and Expert-Level LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16457v1)**<details>Materials synthesis is vital for innovations such as energy storage, catalysis, electronics, and biomedical devices. Yet, the process relies heavily on empirical, trial-and-error methods guided by expert intuition. Our work aims to support the materials science community by providing a practical, data-driven resource. We have curated a comprehensive dataset of 17K expert-verified synthesis recipes from open-access literature, which forms the basis of our newly developed benchmark, AlchemyBench. AlchemyBench offers an end-to-end framework that supports research in large language models applied to synthesis prediction. It encompasses key tasks, including raw materials and equipment prediction, synthesis procedure generation, and characterization outcome forecasting. We propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that leverages large language models for automated evaluation, demonstrating strong statistical agreement with expert assessments.

By utilizing Neural ODEs to model the dynamic evolution of input-output relationships and introducing control mechanisms to optimize output quality, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across multiple question-answer datasets.

Systematically Evaluating and Mitigating Output Format Bias of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08656v2)**<details>We present the first systematic evaluation examining format bias in performance of large language models (LLMs). Our approach distinguishes between two categories of an evaluation metric under format constraints to reliably and accurately assess performance: one measures performance when format constraints are adhered to, while the other evaluates performance regardless of constraint adherence. We then define a metric for measuring the format bias of LLMs and establish effective strategies to reduce it. Subsequently, we present our empirical format bias evaluation spanning four commonly used categories -- multiple-choice question-answer, wrapping, list, and mapping -- covering 15 widely-used formats. Our evaluation on eight generation tasks uncovers significant format bias across state-of-the-art LLMs. We further discover that improving the format-instruction following capabilities of LLMs across formats potentially reduces format bias. Based on our evaluation findings, we study prompting and fine-tuning with synthesized format data techniques to mitigate format bias. Our methods successfully reduce the variance in ChatGPT's performance among wrapping formats from 235.33 to 0.71 (%$^2$).</details> | 2025-02-23 | <details>NAACL 2025 Main Conferenc</details> |

A Black Box Evaluation of LLM Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12103v3)**<details>Large language model unlearning aims to remove harmful information that LLMs have learnt to prevent their use for malicious purposes. LLMU and RMU have been proposed as two methods for LLM unlearning, achieving impressive results on unlearning benchmarks. We study in detail the impact of unlearning on LLM performance metrics using the WMDP dataset as well as a new biology dataset we create. We show that unlearning has a notable impact on general model capabilities, with the performance degradation being more significant in general for LLMU. We further test the robustness of the two methods and find that doing 5-shot prompting or rephrasing the question in simple ways can lead to an over ten-fold increase in accuracy on unlearning benchmarks. Finally, we show that training on unrelated data can almost completely recover pre-unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods fail at truly unlearning. Our methodology serves as an evaluation framework for LLM unlearning methods.

The integration of autonomous driving in military settings reduces human casualties and enables precise and safe execution of missions in hazardous environments while allowing for reliable logistics support without the risks associated with fatigue-related errors. However, relying on autonomous driving solely requires an advanced decision-making model that is adaptable and optimum in any situation. Considering the presence of numerous interconnected autonomous vehicles in mission-critical scenarios, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is vital for ensuring seamless coordination, real-time data exchange, and instantaneous response to dynamic driving environments. The advent of 6G strengthens the Internet of Automated Defense Vehicles (IoADV) concept within the realm of Internet of Military Defense Things (IoMDT) by enabling robust connectivity, crucial for real-time data exchange, advanced navigation, and enhanced safety features through IoADV interactions. On the other hand, a critical advancement in this space is using pre-trained Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making and communication optimization for autonomous driving. Hence, this work presents opportunities and challenges with a vision of realizing the full potential of these technologies in critical defense applications, especially through the advancement of IoADV and its role in enhancing autonomous military operations.</details> | 2025-02-23 | <details>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Internet of Things Magazin</details> |
| **[Ensemble ToT of LLMs and Its Application to Automatic Grading System for Supporting Self-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16399v1)**<details>Providing students with detailed and timely grading feedback is essential for self-learning. While existing LLM-based grading systems are promising, most of them rely on one single model, which limits their performance. To address this, we propose Ensemble Tree-of-Thought (ToT), a framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating multiple models. Using this framework, we develop a grading system. Ensemble ToT follows three steps: (1) analyzing LLM performance, (2) generating candidate answers, and (3) refining them into a final result. Based on this, our grading system first evaluates the grading tendencies of LLMs, then generates multiple results, and finally integrates them via a simulated debate. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's ability to provide accurate and explainable grading by effectively coordinating multiple LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-23 | <details>33 pages, 25 figur</details> |

However, the exploratory nature of data science, alongside the stochastic and opaque outputs of LLMs, raise concerns about their reliability. While prior work focuses on benchmarking LLM accuracy, reproducibility remains underexplored, despite being critical to establishing trust in LLM-driven analysis. We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions. Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting's potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis.

| **[Rational Tuning of LLM Cascades via Probabilistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09345v2)**<details>Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>16 pages, 6 figur</details> |
| **[Towards Context-Robust LLMs: A Gated Representation Fine-tuning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14100v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |
| **[PLDR-LLMs Learn A Generalizable Tensor Operator That Can Replace Its Own Deep Neural Net At Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13502v2)**<details>We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>15 pages, 1 figure, 12 tables, more ablation data inclu</details> |
| **[A generative approach to LLM harmfulness detection with special red flag tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16366v1)**<details>Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>13 pages, 6 figur</details> |

However, the nature of these extracted features and their alignment with human-engineered ones remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art, fine-tuned LLMs for passage reranking. We employ a probing-based analysis to examine neuron activations in ranking LLMs, identifying the presence of known human-engineered and semantic features. Our study spans a broad range of feature categories, including lexical signals, document structure, query-document interactions, and complex semantic representations, to uncover underlying patterns influencing ranking decisions. Through experiments on four different ranking LLMs, we identify statistical IR features that are prominently encoded in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably missing. Furthermore, we analyze how these models respond to out-of-distribution queries and documents, revealing distinct generalization behaviors. By dissecting the latent representations within LLM activations, we aim to improve both the interpretability and effectiveness of ranking models. Our findings offer crucial insights for developing more transparent and reliable retrieval systems, and we release all necessary scripts and code to support further exploration.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>9 pag</details> |
| **[Are LLMs Good Annotators for Discourse-level Event Relation Extraction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19568v3)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in a wide array of natural language processing tasks. However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.

However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>Accepted by NeurIPS '24</details> |

Synthetic data has become a common approach for training models across various NLP tasks. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain for highly subjective tasks like hate speech detection, with previous research yielding mixed results. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data synthesis, utilizing controlled prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques to enhance data quality and diversity. We systematically evaluated 6 open source LLMs on 5 datasets, assessing their ability to generate diverse, high-quality harmful data while minimizing hallucination and duplication. Our results show that Mistral consistently outperforms other open models, and supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances data reliability and diversity. We further analyze the trade-offs between prompt-based vs. fine-tuned toxic data synthesis, discuss real-world deployment challenges, and highlight ethical considerations. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned open source LLMs provide scalable and cost-effective solutions to augment toxic content detection datasets, paving the way for more accessible and transparent content moderation tools.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>14 pag</details> |
| **[Interrogating LLM design under a fair learning doctrine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16290v1)**<details>The current discourse on large language models (LLMs) and copyright largely takes a "behavioral" perspective, focusing on model outputs and evaluating whether they are substantially similar to training data. However, substantial similarity is difficult to define algorithmically and a narrow focus on model outputs is insufficient to address all copyright risks. In this interdisciplinary work, we take a complementary "structural" perspective and shift our focus to how LLMs are trained. We operationalize a notion of "fair learning" by measuring whether any training decision substantially affected the model's memorization. As a case study, we deconstruct Pythia, an open-source LLM, and demonstrate the use of causal and correlational analyses to make factual determinations about Pythia's training decisions. By proposing a legal standard for fair learning and connecting memorization analyses to this standard, we identify how judges may advance the goals of copyright law through adjudication. Finally, we discuss how a fair learning standard might evolve to enhance its clarity by becoming more rule-like and incorporating external technical guidelines.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce ThinkBench, a novel evaluation framework designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning capability robustly. ThinkBench proposes a dynamic data generation method for constructing out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets and offers an OOD dataset that contains 2,912 samples drawn from reasoning tasks. ThinkBench unifies the evaluation of reasoning models and non-reasoning models. We evaluate 16 LLMs and 4 PRMs under identical experimental conditions and show that most of the LLMs' performance are far from robust and they face a certain level of data leakage. By dynamically generating OOD datasets, ThinkBench effectively provides a reliable evaluation of LLMs and reduces the impact of data contamination.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |

We validate the original findings using a range of open-weight models (1.5B-70B parameters) and GPT-4o Mini while introducing several novel contributions. We analyze the Pareto front of the games, propose a communication-free baseline to test whether successful negotiations are possible without agent interaction, evaluate recent small language models' performance, analyze structural information leakage in model responses, and implement an inequality metric to assess negotiation fairness. Our results demonstrate that smaller models (<10B parameters) struggle with format adherence and coherent responses, but larger open-weight models can approach proprietary model performance. Additionally, in many scenarios, single-agent approaches can achieve comparable results to multi-agent negotiations, challenging assumptions about the necessity of agent communication to perform well on the benchmark. This work also provides insights into the accessibility, fairness, environmental impact, and privacy considerations of LLM-based negotiation systems.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |
| **[Dynamic Parallel Tree Search for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16235v1)**<details>Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>17 pages, 11 figur</details> |
| **[On Targeted Manipulation and Deception when Optimizing LLMs for User Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02306v3)**<details>As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>Accepted to ICLR 2025</details> |

However, existing approaches often face inefficiencies and performance limitations caused by frequent channel probing and ineffective quantization. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLMKey, a novel key generation system designed to enhance efficiency and security. We identify excessive channel probing and suboptimal quantization as critical bottlenecks in current methods. To mitigate these issues, we propose an innovative large language model (LLM)-based channel probing technique that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to reduce probing rounds while preserving crucial channel information. Instead of conventional quantization, LLMKey adopts a perturbed compressed sensing-based key delivery mechanism, improving both robustness and security. Extensive evaluations are conducted in four real-world scenarios, encompassing V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) and V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) settings in both urban and rural environments. The results show that LLMKey achieves an average key agreement rate of 98.78\%, highlighting its effectiveness and reliability across diverse conditions.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |

However, utilizing the user data may pose significant privacy risks, potentially leading to ethical dilemmas and violations of data protection regulations. To address the privacy concerns, Federated Learning for Recommendation (Fed4Rec) has been identified as a promising solution. However, directly applying Fed4Rec in the LLM context introduces two challenges: 1) exacerbated client performance imbalance, which ultimately impacts the system's long-term effectiveness, and 2) substantial client resource costs, posing a high demand for clients' both computational and storage capability to locally train and infer LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a federated framework for LLM-based recommendation (shorted as FELLRec). Generally, FELLRec designs two key strategies. 1) Dynamic balance strategy, which designs dynamic parameter aggregation and learning speed for different clients, aiming to ensure balanced performance across clients. 2) Flexible storage strategy, which selectively retains certain sensitive LLM layers on the client side, while offloading other layers to the server, aiming to preserve privacy while saving resources. Experiment results show that FELLRec can achieve a more balanced client performance and improved overall performance in a computational and storage-efficient way while safeguarding user privacy well.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>Accepted by NAACL 2025 Finding</details> |

Do LLMs Understand The Safety of Their Inputs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16174v1)**<details>Ensuring the safety of the Large Language Model (LLM) is critical, but currently used methods in most cases sacrifice the model performance to obtain increased safety or perform poorly on data outside of their adaptation distribution. We investigate existing methods for such generalization and find them insufficient. Surprisingly, while even plain LLMs recognize unsafe prompts, they may still generate unsafe responses. To avoid performance degradation and preserve safe performance, we advocate for a two-step framework, where we first identify unsafe prompts via a lightweight classifier, and apply a "safe" model only to such prompts. In particular, we explore the design of the safety detector in more detail, investigating the use of different classifier architectures and prompting techniques. Interestingly, we find that the final hidden state for the last token is enough to provide robust performance, minimizing false positives on benign data while performing well on malicious prompt detection. Additionally, we show that classifiers trained on the representations from different model layers perform comparably on the latest model layers, indicating that safety representation is present in the LLMs' hidden states at most model stages. Our work is a step towards efficient, representation-based safety mechanisms for LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |

While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

This cognitive bias, supported by neuroscience and behavioral studies, suggests that numerical magnitudes are processed in a sublinear fashion rather than on a uniform linear scale. Inspired by this hypothesis, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a similar logarithmic-like structure in their internal numerical representations. By analyzing how numerical values are encoded across different layers of LLMs, we apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and PLS followed by geometric regression to uncover latent structures in the learned embeddings. Our findings reveal that the model's numerical representations exhibit sublinear spacing, with distances between values aligning with a logarithmic scale. This suggests that LLMs, much like humans, may encode numbers in a compressed, non-uniform manner.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>The number line of LLM</details> |

This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality training data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM mechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing, where model's dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during text generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on this idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by modeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear law, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly with the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length, and (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify hallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model training or inference. Built on overshadowing effect, we propose a new decoding strategy CoDa, to mitigate hallucinations, which notably enhance model factuality on Overshadow (27.9%), MemoTrap (13.1%) and NQ-Swap (18.3%). Our findings not only deepen understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind hallucinations but also provide actionable insights for developing more predictable and controllable language models.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>19 pages, 5 figur</details> |

Using a 190,000-hour dataset primarily sourced from YouTube, pre-processed with Whisper V3 pseudo-labeling, we demonstrate that the LLM-ASR architecture outperforms traditional Zipformer-Transducer models in the zero-shot rare word recognition task, after training on a large dataset. Our analysis reveals that the LLM contributes significantly to improvements in rare word error rate (R-WER), while the speech encoder primarily determines overall transcription performance (Orthographic Word Error Rate, O-WER, and Normalized Word Error Rate, N-WER). Through extensive ablation studies, we highlight the importance of adapter integration in aligning speech encoder outputs with the LLM's linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical role of high-quality labeled data in achieving optimal performance. These findings provide valuable insights into the synergy between LLM-based ASR architectures, paving the way for future advancements in large-scale LLM-based speech recognition systems.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |
| **[Mixture Compressor for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs Gains More](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06270v2)**<details>Mixture-of-Experts large language models (MoE-LLMs) marks a significant step forward of language models, however, they encounter two critical challenges in practice: 1) expert parameters lead to considerable memory consumption and loading latency; and 2) the current activated experts are redundant, as many tokens may only require a single expert. Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>ICLR 2025</details> |
| **[Humanizing the Machine: Proxy Attacks to Mislead LLM Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19230v2)**<details>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>29 pag</details> |
| **[Merger-as-a-Stealer: Stealing Targeted PII from Aligned LLMs with Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16094v1)**<details>Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by integrating multiple domain-specific models into a cross-domain merged model. Despite its utility and plug-and-play nature, unmonitored mergers can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks and model merging abuse. In this paper, we identify a novel and more realistic attack surface where a malicious merger can extract targeted personally identifiable information (PII) from an aligned model with model merging. Specifically, we propose \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer}, a two-stage framework to achieve this attack: First, the attacker fine-tunes a malicious model to force it to respond to any PII-related queries. The attacker then uploads this malicious model to the model merging conductor and obtains the merged model. Second, the attacker inputs direct PII-related queries to the merged model to extract targeted PII. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer} successfully executes attacks against various LLMs and model merging methods across diverse settings, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Given that this attack enables character-level extraction for targeted PII without requiring any additional knowledge from the attacker, we stress the necessity for improved model alignment and more robust defense mechanisms to mitigate such threats.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>17 pages, 3 figur</details> |
| **[CitaLaw: Enhancing LLM with Citations in Legal Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14556v2)**<details>In this paper, we propose CitaLaw, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to produce legally sound responses with appropriate citations. CitaLaw features a diverse set of legal questions for both laypersons and practitioners, paired with a comprehensive corpus of law articles and precedent cases as a reference pool. This framework enables LLM-based systems to retrieve supporting citations from the reference corpus and align these citations with the corresponding sentences in their responses. Moreover, we introduce syllogism-inspired evaluation methods to assess the legal alignment between retrieved references and LLM-generated responses, as well as their consistency with user questions. Extensive experiments on 2 open-domain and 7 legal-specific LLMs demonstrate that integrating legal references substantially enhances response quality. Furthermore, our proposed syllogism-based evaluation method exhibits strong agreement with human judgments.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |
| **[Grounding LLM Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13247v2)**<details>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are valuable tools for representing relationships between entities in a structured format. Traditionally, these knowledge bases are queried to extract specific information. However, question-answering (QA) over such KGs poses a challenge due to the intrinsic complexity of natural language compared to the structured format and the size of these graphs. Despite these challenges, the structured nature of KGs can provide a solid foundation for grounding the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering organizations increased reliability and control. Recent advancements in LLMs have introduced reasoning methods at inference time to improve their performance and maximize their capabilities. In this work, we propose integrating these reasoning strategies with KGs to anchor every step or "thought" of the reasoning chains in KG data. Specifically, we evaluate both agentic and automated search methods across several reasoning strategies, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), using GRBench, a benchmark dataset for graph reasoning with domain-specific graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline models, highlighting the benefits of grounding LLM reasoning processes in structured KG data.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |
| **[Enhancing LLMs for Identifying and Prioritizing Important Medical Jargons from Electronic Health Record Notes Utilizing Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16022v1)**<details>Objective: OpenNotes enables patients to access EHR notes, but medical jargon can hinder comprehension. To improve understanding, we evaluated closed- and open-source LLMs for extracting and prioritizing key medical terms using prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation. Materials and Methods: We assessed LLMs on 106 expert-annotated EHR notes, experimenting with (i) general vs. structured prompts, (ii) zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting, (iii) fine-tuning, and (iv) data augmentation. To enhance open-source models in low-resource settings, we used ChatGPT for data augmentation and applied ranking techniques. We incrementally increased the augmented dataset size (10 to 10,000) and conducted 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1 score and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Results and Discussion: Fine-tuning and data augmentation improved performance over other strategies. GPT-4 Turbo achieved the highest F1 (0.433), while Mistral7B with data augmentation had the highest MRR (0.746). Open-source models, when fine-tuned or augmented, outperformed closed-source models. Notably, the best F1 and MRR scores did not always align. Few-shot prompting outperformed zero-shot in vanilla models, and structured prompts yielded different preferences across models. Fine-tuning improved zero-shot performance but sometimes degraded few-shot performance. Data augmentation performed comparably or better than other methods. Conclusion: Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation in improving model performance for medical jargon extraction in low-resource scenarios.</details> | 2025-02-22 | <details>21pages, 5 figures, 4 tab</details> |

Despite the better user understanding and human-like responses, their lack of controllability remains a key challenge, often leading to unfocused conversations or task failure. To address this, we introduce Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to regulate dialogue flow. Specifically, we propose ChatSOP, a novel SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning framework designed to enhance the controllability of LLM-driven dialogue agents. To enable this, we curate a dataset comprising SOP-annotated multi-scenario dialogues, generated using a semi-automated role-playing system with GPT-4o and validated through strict manual quality control. Additionally, we propose a novel method that integrates Chain of Thought reasoning with supervised fine-tuning for SOP prediction and utilizes SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimal action planning during dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, such as achieving a 27.95% improvement in action accuracy compared to baseline models based on GPT-3.5 and also showing notable gains for open-source models.

This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.</details> | 2025-02-22 |  |

However, they often require to maintain optimizer states throughout training, which can result in memory requirements several times greater than the model footprint. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in contrast, is a stateless optimizer, as it does not track state variables during training. Consequently, it achieves optimal memory efficiency. However, its capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b). In this work, we show that pre-processing SGD in a stateless manner can achieve the same performance as the Adam optimizer for LLM training, while drastically reducing the memory cost. Specifically, we propose to pre-process the instantaneous stochastic gradients using normalization and whitening. We show that normalization stabilizes gradient distributions, and whitening counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any optimizer states. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving $\approx 50\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates comparable or even better performance than Adam: when pre-training the LLaMA model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity using half as many tokens.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>In v2 we have revised the related work, added more comprehensive citations, and clarified our key contribution</details> |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15652v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various natural language tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

To address such limitation, we propose ProjectTest, a project-level benchmark for unit test generation covering Python, Java, and JavaScript. ProjectTest features 20 moderate-sized and high-quality projects per language. We evaluate nine frontier LLMs on ProjectTest and the results show that all frontier LLMs tested exhibit moderate performance on ProjectTest on Python and Java, highlighting the difficulty of ProjectTest. We also conduct a thorough error analysis, which shows that even frontier LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, have significant basic yet critical errors, including compilation and cascade errors. Motivated by this observation, we further evaluate all frontier LLMs under manual error-fixing and self-error-fixing scenarios to assess their potential when equipped with error-fixing mechanisms.

| **[Towards Automated Penetration Testing: Introducing LLM Benchmark, Analysis, and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17141v4)**<details>Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, automated, end-to-end penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while LLama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing end-to-end penetration testing even with some minimal human assistance. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Main Paper 1-9 pages, Supplementary Materials: 10-17, 13 figur</details> |
| **[Probe Pruning: Accelerating LLMs through Dynamic Pruning via Model-Probing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15618v1)**<details>We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise manner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of FLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students toward completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents holistically using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our results and findings can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for a variety of tasks.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

We assessed the performance of eight LLMs, emphasizing key metrics such as response speed and accuracy, which were quantified using BLEU and METEOR scores. Our findings reveal that advanced models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini significantly outperform their counterparts, particularly when addressing complex queries requiring multi-format data integration. The results validate the system's ability to deliver timely and accurate responses, highlighting the potential of RAG frameworks to optimize maintenance operations.

However, we show that current LLMs make key decisions in a representation space closest to English, regardless of their input and output languages. Exploring the internal representations with a logit lens for sentences in French, German, Dutch, and Mandarin, we show that the LLM first emits representations close to English for semantically-loaded words before translating them into the target language. We further show that activation steering in these LLMs is more effective when the steering vectors are computed in English rather than in the language of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that multilingual LLMs perform key reasoning steps in a representation that is heavily shaped by English in a way that is not transparent to system users.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Main paper 9 pages; including appendix 48 pag</details> |

To democratize this process, we introduce WorldCraft, a system where large language model (LLM) agents leverage procedural generation to create indoor and outdoor scenes populated with objects, allowing users to control individual object attributes and the scene layout using intuitive natural language commands. In our framework, a coordinator agent manages the overall process and works with two specialized LLM agents to complete the scene creation: ForgeIt, which integrates an ever-growing manual through auto-verification to enable precise customization of individual objects, and ArrangeIt, which formulates hierarchical optimization problems to achieve a layout that balances ergonomic and aesthetic considerations. Additionally, our pipeline incorporates a trajectory control agent, allowing users to animate the scene and operate the camera through natural language interactions. Our system is also compatible with off-the-shelf deep 3D generators to enrich scene assets. Through evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the versatility of WorldCraft, ranging from single-object customization to intricate, large-scale interior and exterior scene designs. This system empowers non-professionals to bring their creative visions to life.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Unveiling Scoring Processes: Dissecting the Differences between LLMs and Human Graders in Automatic Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18328v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results underscore the need for a nuanced approach when applying LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Accepted by Technology, Knowledge, and Learning (TKNL)</details> |
| **[Interpreting and Steering LLMs with Mutual Information-based Explanations on Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15576v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) excel at handling human queries, but they can occasionally generate flawed or unexpected responses. Understanding their internal states is crucial for understanding their successes, diagnosing their failures, and refining their capabilities. Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise for interpreting LLM internal representations, limited research has explored how to better explain SAE features, i.e., understanding the semantic meaning of features learned by SAE. Our theoretical analysis reveals that existing explanation methods suffer from the frequency bias issue, where they emphasize linguistic patterns over semantic concepts, while the latter is more critical to steer LLM behaviors. To address this, we propose using a fixed vocabulary set for feature interpretations and designing a mutual information-based objective, aiming to better capture the semantic meaning behind these features. We further propose two runtime steering strategies that adjust the learned feature activations based on their corresponding explanations. Empirical results show that, compared to baselines, our method provides more discourse-level explanations and effectively steers LLM behaviors to defend against jailbreak attacks. These findings highlight the value of explanations for steering LLM behaviors in downstream applications. We will release our code and data once accepted.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Pre-print. 20 pages, 5 figur</details> |

This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

However, we observe that dialogue diversity declines significantly over long-term simulation. To investigate the role of prompt design in conversational diversity, we modularized the utterance generation prompt and found that reducing the given information leads to more diverse outputs. Based on this insight, we propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that allows users to control diversity through a single parameter, lambda. APP dynamically prunes the utterance generation prompt based on their attention weights and is compatible with traditional diversity control techniques. We demonstrate that APP effectively controls output diversity through extensive experiments, and propose a method to balance the control trade-offs. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis to offer insights into optimizing diversity control in multi-agent simulation.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Accepted for the AAAI 2025 Workshop on Advancing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration (v1); updated version (v2)</details> |

In this work, we conduct a systematic comparative study on how different retrieval paradigms (sparse vs. dense) and fine-tuning objectives (CL vs. KD vs. their combination) affect retrieval performance across different model scales. Using MSMARCO passages as the training dataset, decoder-only LLMs (Llama-3 series: 1B, 3B, 8B), and a fixed compute budget, we evaluate various training configurations on both in-domain (MSMARCO, TREC DL) and out-of-domain (BEIR) benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that: (1) Scaling behaviors emerge clearly only with CL, where larger models achieve significant performance gains, whereas KD-trained models show minimal improvement, performing similarly across the 1B, 3B, and 8B scales. (2) Sparse retrieval models consistently outperform dense retrieval across both in-domain (MSMARCO, TREC DL) and out-of-domain (BEIR) benchmarks, and they demonstrate greater robustness to imperfect supervised signals. (3) We successfully scale sparse retrieval models with the combination of CL and KD losses at 8B scale, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in all evaluation sets.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Towards Swift Serverless LLM Cold Starts with ParaServe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15524v1)**<details>With the surge in number of large language models (LLMs), the industry turns to serverless computing for LLM inference serving. However, serverless LLM serving suffers from significant cold start latency and service level objective (SLO) violations due to the substantial model size, which leads to prolonged model fetching time from remote storage. We present ParaServe, a serverless LLM serving system that minimizes cold start latency through the novel use of pipeline parallelism. Our insight is that by distributing model parameters across multiple GPU servers, we can utilize their aggregated network bandwidth to concurrently fetch different parts of the model. ParaServe adopts a two-level hierarchical design. At the cluster level, ParaServe determines the optimal degree of parallelism based on user SLOs and carefully places GPU workers across servers to reduce network interference. At the worker level, ParaServe overlaps model fetching, loading, and runtime initialization to further accelerate cold starts. Additionally, ParaServe introduces pipeline consolidation, which merges parallel groups back to individual workers to maintain optimal performance for warm requests. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that ParaServe reduces the cold start latency by up to 4.7x and improves SLO attainment by up to 1.74x compared to baselines.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

However, in highly specialized fields such as cybersecurity, full autonomy remains a challenge. This difficulty primarily stems from the limitations of LLMs in reasoning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge. We propose a system that semi-autonomously executes complex cybersecurity workflows by employing multiple LLMs modules to formulate attack strategies, generate commands, and analyze results, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. In our experiments using Hack The Box virtual machines, we confirmed that our system can autonomously construct attack strategies, issue appropriate commands, and automate certain processes, thereby reducing the need for manual intervention.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>7 pages, 4 tables and 1 figur</details> |

Despite their potential to enhance learning, there is a lack of standardized frameworks to mitigate these risks. Through a systematic literature review, we identify key parental and empirical concerns, including toxicity and ethical breaches in AI outputs. Moreover, to address these issues, this paper proposes a protection framework for safe Child-LLM interaction, incorporating metrics for content safety, behavioral ethics, and cultural sensitivity. The framework provides practical tools for evaluating LLM safety, offering guidance for developers, policymakers, and educators to ensure responsible AI deployment for children.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Adversarial Alignment for LLMs Requires Simpler, Reproducible, and More Measurable Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11910v2)**<details>Misaligned research objectives have considerably hindered progress in adversarial robustness research over the past decade. For instance, an extensive focus on optimizing target metrics, while neglecting rigorous standardized evaluation, has led researchers to pursue ad-hoc heuristic defenses that were seemingly effective. Yet, most of these were exposed as flawed by subsequent evaluations, ultimately contributing little measurable progress to the field. In this position paper, we illustrate that current research on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past patterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we argue that realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in adversarial alignment. To this end, we build on established cybersecurity taxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models that apply to LLMs. Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires disentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning to core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and comparability. Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh start on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past experience while avoiding previous mistakes.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Adversarial Prompt Evaluation: Systematic Benchmarking of Guardrails Against Prompt Input Attacks on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15427v1)**<details>As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into everyday applications, ensuring their robustness and security is increasingly critical. In particular, LLMs can be manipulated into unsafe behaviour by prompts known as jailbreaks. The variety of jailbreak styles is growing, necessitating the use of external defences known as guardrails. While many jailbreak defences have been proposed, not all defences are able to handle new out-of-distribution attacks due to the narrow segment of jailbreaks used to align them. Moreover, the lack of systematisation around defences has created significant gaps in their practical application. In this work, we perform systematic benchmarking across 15 different defences, considering a broad swathe of malicious and benign datasets. We find that there is significant performance variation depending on the style of jailbreak a defence is subject to. Additionally, we show that based on current datasets available for evaluation, simple baselines can display competitive out-of-distribution performance compared to many state-of-the-art defences.

In this paper, we introduce MultiSynFact, the first large-scale multilingual fact-checking dataset containing 2.2M claim-source pairs designed to support Spanish, German, English, and other low-resource languages. Our dataset generation pipeline leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating external knowledge from Wikipedia and incorporating rigorous claim validation steps to ensure data quality.

Previous methods typically relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning. Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be publicly available subsequently.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

While HCI research focuses on domain-specific applications, little is known about how heavy users integrate LLMs into everyday decision-making. Through qualitative interviews with heavy LLM users (n=7) who employ these systems for both intuitive and analytical thinking tasks, our findings show that participants use LLMs for social validation, self-regulation, and interpersonal guidance, seeking to build self-confidence and optimize cognitive resources. These users viewed LLMs either as rational, consistent entities or average human decision-makers. Our findings suggest that heavy LLM users develop nuanced interaction patterns beyond simple delegation, highlighting the need to reconsider how we study LLM integration in decision-making processes.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

Due to computational constraints during both training and inference, we focused on smaller models. To train TituLLMs, we collected a pretraining dataset of approximately ~37 billion tokens. We extended the Llama-3.2 tokenizer to incorporate language- and culture-specific knowledge, which also enables faster training and inference. There was a lack of benchmarking datasets to benchmark LLMs for Bangla. To address this gap, we developed five benchmarking datasets. We benchmarked various LLMs, including TituLLMs, and demonstrated that TituLLMs outperforms its initial multilingual versions. However, this is not always the case, highlighting the complexities of language adaptation. Our work lays the groundwork for adapting existing multilingual open models to other low-resource languages. To facilitate broader adoption and further research, we have made the TituLLMs models and benchmarking datasets publicly available (https://huggingface.co/collections/hishab/titulm-llama-family-6718d31fc1b83529276f490a).</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>LLMs, Benchmarking, Large Language Models, Bang</details> |

However, when bias is mixed within the reasoning process to form strong logical arguments, it could cause even more harmful results and further induce hallucinations. In this paper, we have evaluated the 8B and 32B variants of DeepSeek-R1 against their instruction tuned counterparts on the BBQ dataset, and investigated the bias that is elicited out and being amplified through reasoning steps. To the best of our knowledge, this empirical study is the first to assess bias issues in LLM reasoning.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Stepwise Informativeness Search for Improving LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15335v1)**<details>Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved multi-step reasoning through generating free-text rationales. However, recent studies show that LLMs tend to lose focus over the middle of long contexts. This raises concerns that as reasoning progresses, LLMs may overlook information in earlier steps when decoding subsequent steps, leading to generate unreliable and redundant rationales. To address this, we propose guiding LLMs to generate more accurate and concise step-by-step rationales by (1) proactively referencing information from underutilized prior steps, and (2) minimizing redundant information between new and existing steps. We introduce stepwise informativeness search, an inference-time tree search framework incorporating two selection heuristics: grounding-guided selection which prioritizes steps paying higher attention over underutilized steps; and novelty-guided selection which encourages steps with novel conclusions. During rationale generation, we use a self-grounding strategy that prompts LLMs to explicitly reference relevant prior steps to provide premises before deduction at each step. Experimental results on four reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning accuracy by generating higher-quality rationales with reduced errors and redundancy.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Preprin</details> |
| **[SVDq: 1.25-bit and 410x Key Cache Compression for LLM Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15304v1)**<details>For the efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), the effective compression of key-value (KV) cache is essential. Three main types of KV cache compression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization, have been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K cache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations. Since the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after only a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware quantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective allocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we prove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are much lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space. Our findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can achieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined with key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for attention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance. Notably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates that SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more efficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Mitigating Tail Narrowing in LLM Self-Improvement via Socratic-Guided Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00750v2)**<details>Self-improvement methods enable large language models (LLMs) to generate solutions themselves and iteratively train on filtered, high-quality rationales. This process proves effective and reduces the reliance on human supervision in LLMs' reasoning, but the performance soon plateaus. We delve into the process and find that models tend to over-sample on easy queries and under-sample on queries they have yet to master. As iterations proceed, this imbalance in sampling is exacerbated, leading to a long-tail distribution where solutions to difficult queries almost diminish. This phenomenon limits the performance gain of self-improving models. A straightforward solution is brute-force sampling to balance the distribution, which significantly raises computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Guided Self-Improvement (GSI), a strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of sampling challenging heavy-tailed data. It leverages Socratic-style guidance signals to help LLM reasoning with complex queries, reducing the exploration effort and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments on four models across diverse mathematical tasks show that GSI strikes a balance between performance and efficiency, while also being effective on held-out tasks.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main Conference.

While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our method enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times larger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>25 pages, 12 figur</details> |

In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evaluation direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM's response score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models, we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking. We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the consistency of each LLM's capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is that high-level LLM can evaluate others' answers more accurately than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover, we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

However, this development raises substantial privacy concerns, as users' prompts are transmitted to and processed by the model providers. Among the various privacy protection methods for LLMs, those implemented during the pre-training and fine-tuning phrases fail to mitigate the privacy risks associated with the remote use of cloud-based LLMs by users. On the other hand, methods applied during the inference phrase are primarily effective in scenarios where the LLM's inference does not rely on privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we outline the process of remote user interaction with LLMs and, for the first time, propose a detailed definition of a general pseudonymization framework applicable to cloud-based LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework strikes an optimal balance between privacy protection and utility.

This experience offers users a significantly higher level of controllability compared to traditional RS, enabling an entirely new dimension of recommendation experiences. Building on this context, this study explored the unique experiences that LLM-powered CRS can provide compared to traditional RS. Through a three-week diary study with 12 participants using custom GPTs for music recommendations, we found that LLM-powered CRS can (1) help users clarify implicit needs, (2) support unique exploration, and (3) facilitate a deeper understanding of musical preferences. Based on these findings, we discuss the new design space enabled by LLM-powered CRS and highlight its potential to support more personalized, user-driven recommendation experiences.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

While the "personification" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

This paper presents CLUE, an LLM-powered interviewer that conducts in-the-moment user experience interviews, right after users interacted with LLMs, and automatically gathers insights about user opinions from massive interview logs. We conduct a study with thousands of users to understand user opinions on mainstream LLMs, recruiting users to first chat with a target LLM and then interviewed by CLUE. Our experiments demonstrate that CLUE captures interesting user opinions, for example, the bipolar views on the displayed reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 and demands for information freshness and multi-modality.

Scientific discovery is an iterative process that demands efficient knowledge updating and encoding. It involves understanding the environment, identifying new hypotheses, and reasoning about actions; however, no standardized benchmark specifically designed for scientific discovery exists for LLM agents. In response to these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, \textit{Auto-Bench}, that encompasses necessary aspects to evaluate LLMs for scientific discovery in both natural and social sciences. Our benchmark is based on the principles of causal graph discovery. It challenges models to uncover hidden structures and make optimal decisions, which includes generating valid justifications. By engaging interactively with an oracle, the models iteratively refine their understanding of underlying interactions, the chemistry and social interactions, through strategic interventions. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini, Qwen, Claude, and Llama, and observe a significant performance drop as the problem complexity increases, which suggests an important gap between machine and human intelligence that future development of LLMs need to take into consideration.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>13 pag</details> |

A sudden increase in the number of inference requests to a cloud-hosted LLM can deplete GPU memory, leading to contention between multiple prompts for limited resources. Modern LLM serving engines deal with the challenge of limited GPU memory using admission control, which causes them to be unresponsive during request bursts. We propose that preemptive scheduling of prompts in time slices is essential for ensuring responsive LLM inference, especially under conditions of high load and limited GPU memory. However, preempting prompt inference incurs a high paging overhead, which reduces inference throughput. We present Aqua, a GPU memory management framework that significantly reduces the overhead of paging inference state, achieving both responsive and high-throughput inference even under bursty request patterns. We evaluate Aqua by hosting several state-of-the-art large generative ML models of different modalities on servers with 8 Nvidia H100 80G GPUs. Aqua improves the responsiveness of LLM inference by 20X compared to the state-of-the-art and improves LLM inference throughput over a single long prompt by 4X.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

Although existing work uses LLM to achieve this goal, their method does not use an end-to-end approach and avoids the LLM in the mapping of fMRI-to-text, leaving space for the exploration of the LLM in auditory decoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, the Brain Prompt GPT (BP-GPT). By using the brain representation that is extracted from the fMRI as a prompt, our method can utilize GPT-2 to decode fMRI signals into stimulus text. Further, we introduce the text prompt and align the fMRI prompt to it. By introducing the text prompt, our BP-GPT can extract a more robust brain prompt and promote the decoding of pre-trained LLM. We evaluate our BP-GPT on the open-source auditory semantic decoding dataset and achieve a significant improvement up to 4.61 on METEOR and 2.43 on BERTScore across all the subjects compared to the state-of-the-art method. The experimental results demonstrate that using brain representation as a prompt to further drive LLM for auditory neural decoding is feasible and effective.

Exploring Safety-Reasoning Trade-offs in Prompting and Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09673v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various NLP benchmarks. However, excelling in complex tasks that require nuanced reasoning and precise decision-making demands more than raw language proficiency--LLMs must reason, i.e., think logically, draw from past experiences, and synthesize information to reach conclusions and take action. To enhance reasoning abilities, approaches such as prompting and fine-tuning have been widely explored. While these methods have led to clear improvements in reasoning, their impact on LLM safety remains less understood. In this work, we investigate the interplay between reasoning and safety in LLMs. We highlight the latent safety risks that arise as reasoning capabilities improve, shedding light on previously overlooked vulnerabilities. At the same time, we explore how reasoning itself can be leveraged to enhance safety, uncovering potential mitigation strategies. By examining both the risks and opportunities in reasoning-driven LLM safety, our study provides valuable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more trustworthy in real-world deployments.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |

To address these challenges, we propose RLTHF, a human-AI hybrid framework that combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human annotations to achieve full-human annotation alignment with minimal effort. RLTHF identifies hard-to-annotate samples mislabeled by LLMs using a reward model's reward distribution and iteratively enhances alignment by integrating strategic human corrections while leveraging LLM's correctly labeled samples. Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that RLTHF reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort. Furthermore, models trained on RLTHF's curated datasets for downstream tasks outperform those trained on fully human-annotated datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of RLTHF's strategic data curation.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
