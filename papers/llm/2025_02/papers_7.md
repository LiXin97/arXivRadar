| **[My LLM might Mimic AAE -- But When Should it?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04564v2)**<details>We examine the representation of African American English (AAE) in large language models (LLMs), exploring (a) the perceptions Black Americans have of how effective these technologies are at producing authentic AAE, and (b) in what contexts Black Americans find this desirable. Through both a survey of Black Americans ($n=$ 104) and annotation of LLM-produced AAE by Black Americans ($n=$ 228), we find that Black Americans favor choice and autonomy in determining when AAE is appropriate in LLM output. They tend to prefer that LLMs default to communicating in Mainstream U.S. English in formal settings, with greater interest in AAE production in less formal settings. When LLMs were appropriately prompted and provided in context examples, our participants found their outputs to have a level of AAE authenticity on par with transcripts of Black American speech.

| **[Open-Nav: Exploring Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environment with Open-Source LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18794v2)**<details>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to follow textual instructions to navigate through 3D environments. Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>Accepted by ICRA 2025</details> |
| **[Ask Patients with Patience: Enabling LLMs for Human-Centric Medical Dialogue with Grounded Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07143v1)**<details>Accurate and efficient diagnosis in online medical consultations remains a challenge for current large language models. These models often rely on single-turn interactions and lack the ability to refine their predictions through follow-up questions. Additionally, their responses frequently contain complex medical terminology, making them less accessible to non-medical users and creating barriers to effective communication. In this paper, we introduce Ask Patients with Patience (APP), the first multi-turn dialogue that enables LLMs to iteratively refine diagnoses based on grounded reasoning. By integrating medical guidelines and entropy minimization, APP improves both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, it features human-centric communication that bridges the gap between user comprehension and medical terminology, significantly enhancing user accessibility and engagement. We evaluated APP using a subset of the ReMeDi dataset, comparing it with single-turn and traditional multi-turn LLM baselines. APP achieved higher similarity scores in diagnosis predictions, demonstrating better alignment with ground truth diagnoses. Entropy analysis showed that APP reduces diagnostic uncertainty more rapidly across iterations, increasing confidence in its predictions. APP also excels in user accessibility and empathy, further bridging the gap between complex medical language and user understanding. Code will be released at: https://github.com/SuperMedIntel/AskPatients.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of LLMs using Particle-Based Monte Carlo Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01618v3)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

| **[Blind Spot Navigation in LLM Reasoning with Thought Space Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24155v2)**<details>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model to solve the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we design the Thought Space Explorer (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought space and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Universal Adversarial Attack on Aligned Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07987v1)**<details>We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., ''Sure, here it is'') or otherwise unsafe content-even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench benchmark, our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 93% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model transferability by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously and testing on unseen architectures. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license. Warning: some content generated by Multimodal LLMs in this paper may be offensive to some readers.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Deep Semantic Graph Learning via LLM based Node Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07982v1)**<details>Graph learning has attracted significant attention due to its widespread real-world applications. Current mainstream approaches rely on text node features and obtain initial node embeddings through shallow embedding learning using GNNs, which shows limitations in capturing deep textual semantics. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capabilities in understanding text semantics, transforming traditional text feature processing. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines Graph Transformer architecture with LLM-enhanced node features. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to generate rich semantic representations of text nodes, which are then processed by a multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Graph Transformer to capture both local and global graph structural information. Our model utilizes the Transformer's attention mechanism to dynamically aggregate neighborhood information while preserving the semantic richness provided by LLM embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-enhanced node features significantly improve the performance of graph learning models on node classification tasks. This approach shows promising results across multiple graph learning tasks, offering a practical direction for combining graph networks with language models.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[CIRCUIT: A Benchmark for Circuit Interpretation and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07980v1)**<details>The role of Large Language Models (LLMs) has not been extensively explored in analog circuit design, which could benefit from a reasoning-based approach that transcends traditional optimization techniques. In particular, despite their growing relevance, there are no benchmarks to assess LLMs' reasoning capability about circuits. Therefore, we created the CIRCUIT dataset consisting of 510 question-answer pairs spanning various levels of analog-circuit-related subjects. The best-performing model on our dataset, GPT-4o, achieves 48.04% accuracy when evaluated on the final numerical answer. To evaluate the robustness of LLMs on our dataset, we introduced a unique feature that enables unit-test-like evaluation by grouping questions into unit tests. In this case, GPT-4o can only pass 27.45% of the unit tests, highlighting that the most advanced LLMs still struggle with understanding circuits, which requires multi-level reasoning, particularly when involving circuit topologies. This circuit-specific benchmark highlights LLMs' limitations, offering valuable insights for advancing their application in analog integrated circuit design.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[From Hazard Identification to Controller Design: Proactive and LLM-Supported Safety Engineering for ML-Powered Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07974v1)**<details>Machine learning (ML) components are increasingly integrated into software products, yet their complexity and inherent uncertainty often lead to unintended and hazardous consequences, both for individuals and society at large. Despite these risks, practitioners seldom adopt proactive approaches to anticipate and mitigate hazards before they occur. Traditional safety engineering approaches, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), offer systematic frameworks for early risk identification but are rarely adopted. This position paper advocates for integrating hazard analysis into the development of any ML-powered software product and calls for greater support to make this process accessible to developers. By using large language models (LLMs) to partially automate a modified STPA process with human oversight at critical steps, we expect to address two key challenges: the heavy dependency on highly experienced safety engineering experts, and the time-consuming, labor-intensive nature of traditional hazard analysis, which often impedes its integration into real-world development workflows. We illustrate our approach with a running example, demonstrating that many seemingly unanticipated issues can, in fact, be anticipated.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>Accepted for publication at the International Conference on AI Engineering (CAIN) 2025</details> |
| **[Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization for LLM Self-Improvement via Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05400v2)**<details>Although LLMs have achieved significant success, their reliance on large volumes of human-annotated data has limited their potential for further scaling. In this situation, utilizing self-generated synthetic data has become crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without extensive human annotation. However, current methods often fail to ensure consistent improvements across iterations, with performance stagnating after only minimal updates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO). DNPO employs a dynamic sample labeling mechanism to construct preference pairs for training and introduces controlled, trainable noise into the preference optimization process. Our approach effectively prevents stagnation and enables continuous improvement. In experiments with Zephyr-7B, DNPO consistently outperforms existing methods, showing an average performance boost of 2.6% across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DNPO shows a significant improvement in model-generated data quality, with a 29.4% win-loss rate gap compared to the baseline in GPT-4 evaluations. This highlights its effectiveness in enhancing model performance through iterative refinement.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>Due to an update in the company's publication approval process, a newly appointed manager has been added to the review workflow.

Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>20 pages, 10 figures, 3 tab</details> |
| **[Symbiotic Cooperation for Web Agents: Harnessing Complementary Strengths of Large and Small LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07942v1)**<details>Web browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential in automating complex web-based tasks. Existing approaches typically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and generate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval (for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that remains decoupled from the exploration. In this paper, we propose AgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with task-performance, yielding a "symbiotic improvement" for both large and small LLMs. Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large LLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the distilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often choose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts. This divergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the synthesized data. However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs becomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process. To address this, we propose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis strategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach designed to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. Furthermore, we introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy concerns. Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA performance with both LLM types. Our best Large LLM agent reaches 52%, surpassing the previous best of 45%, while our 8B distilled model demonstrates a competitive 49%, exceeding the prior best of 28%. Code will be released upon acceptance.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[CSR-Bench: Benchmarking LLM Agents in Deployment of Computer Science Research Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06111v2)**<details>The increasing complexity of computer science research projects demands more effective tools for deploying code repositories. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Anthropic Claude and Meta Llama, have demonstrated significant advancements across various fields of computer science research, including the automation of diverse software engineering tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex code development tasks of research projects, particularly for NLP/CV/AI/ML/DM topics, we introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for Computer Science Research projects. This benchmark assesses LLMs from various aspects including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment script quality, aiming to explore their potential in conducting computer science research autonomously. We also introduce a novel framework, CSR-Agents, that utilizes multiple LLM agents to automate the deployment of GitHub code repositories of computer science research projects. Specifically, by checking instructions from markdown files and interpreting repository structures, the model generates and iteratively improves bash commands that set up the experimental environments and deploy the code to conduct research tasks. Preliminary results from CSR-Bench indicate that LLM agents can significantly enhance the workflow of repository deployment, thereby boosting developer productivity and improving the management of developmental workflows.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Distributed Approach to Haskell Based Applications Refactoring with LLMs Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07928v1)**<details>We present a large language models (LLMs) based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring of Haskell codebases. The multi-agent system consists of specialized agents performing tasks such as context analysis, refactoring, validation, and testing. Refactoring improvements are using metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, run-time, and memory allocation. Experimental evaluations conducted on Haskell codebases demonstrate improvements in code quality. Cyclomatic complexity was reduced by 13.64% and 47.06% in the respective codebases. Memory allocation improved by 4.17% and 41.73%, while runtime efficiency increased by up to 50%. These metrics highlight the systems ability to optimize Haskells functional paradigms while maintaining correctness and scalability. Results show reductions in complexity and performance enhancements across codebases. The integration of LLMs based multi-agent system enables precise task execution and inter-agent collaboration, addressing the challenges of refactoring in functional programming. This approach aims to address the challenges of refactoring functional programming languages through distributed and modular systems.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Rescriber: Smaller-LLM-Powered User-Led Data Minimization for LLM-Based Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11876v3)**<details>The proliferation of LLM-based conversational agents has resulted in excessive disclosure of identifiable or sensitive information. However, existing technologies fail to offer perceptible control or account for users' personal preferences about privacy-utility tradeoffs due to the lack of user involvement. To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=12) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users' subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4o. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users' trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Elevating Legal LLM Responses: Harnessing Trainable Logical Structures and Semantic Knowledge with Legal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07912v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across numerous domains, yet they experience notable deficiencies in legal question-answering tasks. LLMs often generate generalized responses that lack the logical specificity required for expert legal advice and are prone to hallucination, providing answers that appear correct but are unreliable. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques offer partial solutions to address this challenge, but existing approaches typically focus only on semantic similarity, neglecting the logical structure essential to legal reasoning. In this paper, we propose the Logical-Semantic Integration Model (LSIM), a novel supervised framework that bridges semantic and logical coherence. LSIM comprises three components: reinforcement learning predicts a structured fact-rule chain for each question, a trainable Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM) retrieves the most relevant candidate questions by integrating semantic and logical features, and in-context learning generates the final answer using the retrieved content. Our experiments on a real-world legal QA dataset-validated through both automated metrics and human evaluation-demonstrate that LSIM significantly enhances accuracy and reliability compared to existing methods.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[HexGen-2: Disaggregated Generative Inference of LLMs in Heterogeneous Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07903v1)**<details>Disaggregating the prefill and decoding phases represents an effective new paradigm for generative inference of large language models (LLM), which eliminates prefill-decoding interference and optimizes resource allocation. However, it is still an open problem about how to deploy the disaggregated inference paradigm across a group of heterogeneous GPUs, which can be an economical alternative to deployment over homogeneous high-performance GPUs. Towards this end, we introduce HexGen-2, a distributed system for efficient and economical LLM serving on heterogeneous GPUs following the disaggregated paradigm. Built on top of HexGen, the core component of HexGen-2 is a scheduling algorithm that formalizes the allocation of disaggregated LLM inference computations and communications over heterogeneous GPUs and network connections as a constraint optimization problem. We leverage the graph partitioning and max-flow algorithms to co-optimize resource allocation, parallel strategies for distinct inference phases, and the efficiency of inter-phase key-value (KV) cache communications. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HexGen-2, i.e., on OPT (30B) and Llama-2 (70B) models in various real-world settings, the results reveal that HexGen-2 delivers up to a 2.0 times and on average a 1.3 times improvement in serving throughput, reduces the average inference latency by 1.5 times compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, and achieves comparable inference performance with a 30% lower price budget.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>ICLR 2025</details> |
| **[Bridging LLM-Generated Code and Requirements: Reverse Generation technique and SBC Metric for Developer Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07835v1)**<details>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering, particularly in code generation, has garnered significant attention. However, assessing the quality of AI-generated code remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of programming tasks and the lack of robust evaluation metrics that align well with human judgment. Traditional token-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, while commonly used in natural language processing, exhibit weak correlations with human assessments in code intelligence and verification tasks. Furthermore, these metrics are primarily research focused and are not designed for seamless integration into the software development lifecycle, limiting their practical utility for developers seeking to improve code quality and security. AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior developers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and compliance. In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code. To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy. The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations. Our code and datasets are available on GitHub</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Effect of Adaptive Communication Support on LLM-powered Human-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06808v2)**<details>Effective human-robot collaboration requires robot to adopt their roles and levels of support based on human needs, task requirements, and complexity. Traditional human-robot teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance, and a Manager for subtask-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited a stronger preference towards robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive robotic agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to a large number of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communications to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>13 pages, 7 figur</details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752v1)**<details>Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Verifying LLM-Generated Code in the Context of Software Verification with Ada/SPARK](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07728v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable code generation capabilities, but the correctness of the generated code cannot be inherently trusted. This paper explores the feasibility of using formal software verification, specifically the SPARK framework for Ada, to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated code. We present Marmaragan, a tool that leverages an LLM in order to generate SPARK annotations for existing programs, enabling formal verification of the code. The tool is benchmarked on a curated set of SPARK programs, with annotations selectively removed to test specific capabilities. The performance of Marmaragan with GPT-4o on the benchmark is promising, with correct annotations having been generated for 50.7% of the benchmark cases. The results establish a foundation for future work on combining the power of LLMs with the reliability of formal software verification.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Glinthawk: A Two-Tiered Architecture for Offline LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11779v2)**<details>We introduce Glinthawk, an architecture for offline Large Language Model (LLM) inference. By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the utilization of the high-end accelerators ("Tier 1") by offloading the attention mechanism to lower-end compute tier ("Tier 2"). This separation allows the memory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale independently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU VMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch processing. The prototype is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[MAGELLAN: Metacognitive predictions of learning progress guide autotelic LLM agents in large goal spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07709v1)**<details>Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP). When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

Large language models (LLMs) are AI systems engineered to analyze and produce text resembling human language, leveraging extensive datasets. This study introduces a framework wherein LLMs are employed as Design Assistants, focusing on three key modalities within the Design Process: Idea Exploration, Dialogue with Designers, and Design Evaluation. Importantly, our framework is not confined to a singular design process but is adaptable across various processes.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

To address such limitation, we propose ProjectTest, a project-level benchmark for unit test generation covering Python, Java, and JavaScript. ProjectTest features 20 moderate-sized and high-quality projects per language. We evaluate nine frontier LLMs on ProjectTest and the results show that all frontier LLMs tested exhibit moderate performance on ProjectTest on Python and Java, highlighting the difficulty of ProjectTest. We also conduct a thorough error analysis, which shows that even frontier LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, have significant simple errors, including compilation and cascade errors. Motivated by this observation, we further evaluate all frontier LLMs under manual error-fixing and self-error-fixing scenarios to assess their potential when equipped with error-fixing mechanisms.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Model Surgery: Modulating LLM's Behavior Via Simple Parameter Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08770v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential as generalist assistants, showcasing powerful task understanding and problem-solving capabilities. To deploy LLMs as AI assistants, it is crucial that these models exhibit desirable behavioral traits, such as non-toxicity and resilience against jailbreak attempts. Current approaches for detoxification or preventing jailbreaking usually involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which requires finetuning billions of parameters through gradient descent with substantial computational cost. Furthermore, models modified through SFT and RLHF may deviate from the pretrained models, potentially leading to a degradation in foundational LLM capabilities. In this paper, we observe that surprisingly, directly editing a small subset of parameters can effectively modulate specific behaviors of LLMs, such as detoxification and resistance to jailbreaking, with only inference-level computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that in the detoxification task, our approach achieves reductions of up to 90.0% in toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and 49.2% on ToxiGen, while maintaining the LLM's general capabilities in areas such as common sense, question answering, and mathematic</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>23 pages, 14 figur</details> |
| **[CoCoA: A Generalized Approach to Uncertainty Quantification by Integrating Confidence and Consistency of LLM Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04964v2)**<details>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompasses a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches and shown impressive performance in various applications. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that leads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

However, current rating systems suffer from several important limitations: first, they fail to account for biases that significantly influence evaluation results, second, they require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and third, they do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Further, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>work in progress. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.09673 by other author</details> |

Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>ICLR 2025; 28 pages, 8 figur</details> |

This imbalance presents a significant challenge, as LLMs are increasingly used across diverse contexts without adequate evaluation of their cultural competence in non-English languages, including Persian. To address this gap, we introduce PerCul, a carefully constructed dataset designed to assess the sensitivity of LLMs toward Persian culture. PerCul features story-based, multiple-choice questions that capture culturally nuanced scenarios. Unlike existing benchmarks, PerCul is curated with input from native Persian annotators to ensure authenticity and to prevent the use of translation as a shortcut. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual and Persian-specific LLMs, establishing a foundation for future research in cross-cultural NLP evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate a 11.3% gap between best closed source model and layperson baseline while the gap increases to 21.3% by using the best open-weight model.

We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[Approximating Human Strategic Reasoning with LLM-Enhanced Recursive Reasoners Leveraging Multi-agent Hypergames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07443v1)**<details>LLM-driven multi-agent-based simulations have been gaining traction with applications in game-theoretic and social simulations. While most implementations seek to exploit or evaluate LLM-agentic reasoning, they often do so with a weak notion of agency and simplified architectures. We implement a role-based multi-agent strategic interaction framework tailored to sophisticated recursive reasoners, providing the means for systematic in-depth development and evaluation of strategic reasoning. Our game environment is governed by the umpire responsible for facilitating games, from matchmaking through move validation to environment management. Players incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs in their decision mechanism, relying on a formal hypergame-based model of hierarchical beliefs. We use one-shot, 2-player beauty contests to evaluate the recursive reasoning capabilities of the latest LLMs, providing a comparison to an established baseline model from economics and data from human experiments. Furthermore, we introduce the foundations of an alternative semantic measure of reasoning to the k-level theory. Our experiments show that artificial reasoners can outperform the baseline model in terms of both approximating human behaviour and reaching the optimal solution.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

A fundamental question arises: how do LLMs achieve such robust multilingual capabilities? For non-Latin script languages, we investigate the role of romanization - the representation of non-Latin scripts using Latin characters - as a bridge in multilingual processing. Using mechanistic interpretability techniques, we analyze next-token generation and find that intermediate layers frequently represent target words in romanized form before transitioning to native script, a phenomenon we term Latent Romanization. Further, through activation patching experiments, we demonstrate that LLMs encode semantic concepts similarly across native and romanized scripts, suggesting a shared underlying representation. Additionally in translation towards non Latin languages, our findings reveal that when the target language is in romanized form, its representations emerge earlier in the model's layers compared to native script. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of multilingual representation in LLMs and highlight the implicit role of romanization in facilitating language transfer. Our work provides new directions for potentially improving multilingual language modeling and interpretability.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>18 pages, 18 figur</details> |
| **[Re-evaluating Automatic LLM System Ranking for Alignment with Human Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00560v2)**<details>Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>Findings of NAACL 2025</details> |

For these manufacturers, a first step towards this goal is to identify the environmental impact of the individual components of their products. We propose a system leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically map components from manufacturer Bills of Materials (BOMs) to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database entries by using LLMs to expand on available component information. Our approach reduces the need for manual data processing, paving the way for more accessible sustainability practices.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |
| **[LLMs Can Easily Learn to Reason from Demonstrations Structure, not content, is what matters!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07374v1)**<details>Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation. However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models.

Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), an uncertainty-aware approach, enables uncertainty estimation in a single forward pass, making it a promising method for calibrating fine-tuned LLMs. However, despite its computational efficiency, EDL is prone to overfitting, as its training objective can result in overly concentrated probability distributions. To mitigate this, we propose regularizing EDL by incorporating an information bottleneck (IB). Our approach IB-EDL suppresses spurious information in the evidence generated by the model and encourages truly predictive information to influence both the predictions and uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments across various fine-tuned LLMs and tasks demonstrate that IB-EDL outperforms both existing EDL and non-EDL approaches. By improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, IB-EDL facilitates their broader adoption in domains requiring high levels of confidence calibration.

Detecting such manipulations traditionally relies on the manual effort of experienced experts, presenting significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-driven framework that automates the detection of price oracle manipulations by leveraging the complementary strengths of different LLM models. Our approach begins with domain-specific knowledge extraction, where an LLM model synthesizes precise insights about price oracle vulnerabilities from top-tier academic papers, eliminating the need for profound expertise from developers or auditors. This knowledge forms the foundation for a second LLM model to generate structured, context-aware chain of thought prompts, which guide a third LLM model in accurately identifying manipulation patterns in smart contracts. We validate the framework effectiveness through experiments on 60 known vulnerabilities from 46 real-world DeFi attacks or projects spanning 2021 to 2023. The best performing combination of LLMs (Haiku-Haiku-4o-mini) identified by AiRacleX demonstrate a 2.58-times improvement in recall (0.667 vs 0.259) compared to the state-of-the-art tool GPTScan, while maintaining comparable precision. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of replacing commercial models with open-source alternatives, enhancing privacy and security for developers.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Unlike existing multilingual datasets primarily derived from English translations, these benchmarks are constructed based on real-world scenarios from SEA regions. SeaExam draws from regional educational exams to form a comprehensive dataset that encompasses subjects such as local history and literature. In contrast, SeaBench is crafted around multi-turn, open-ended tasks that reflect daily interactions within SEA communities.

Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structural attributes}$ (response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavioral attributes}$ (answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggests potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |
| **[Confidence Improves Self-Consistency in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06233v1)**<details>Self-consistency decoding enhances LLMs' performance on reasoning tasks by sampling diverse reasoning paths and selecting the most frequent answer. However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, our results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

However, their reliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises significant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is unintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The data leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research and evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there is no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE benchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our results show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with average leakage ratios of only 4.8\%, 2.8\%, and 0.7\% for Python, Java, and C/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively higher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation. For instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\% and 55.7\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a substantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data leakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training datasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark construction. To address the data leakage, we introduce \textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the 83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research. Our study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and provides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>25 pag</details> |

However, whether generating ideas with the help of LLMs leads to idea fixation or idea expansion is unclear. This study examines how different timings of LLM usage - either at the beginning or after independent ideation - affect people's perceptions and ideation outcomes in a writing task. In a controlled experiment with 60 participants, we found that using LLMs from the beginning reduced the number of original ideas and lowered creative self-efficacy and self-credit, mediated by changes in autonomy and ownership. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using LLMs to assist in idea generation. We propose delaying the use of LLMs to support ideation while considering users' self-efficacy, autonomy, and ownership of the ideation outcomes.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>16 pag</details> |

An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06193v1)**<details>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns.

Additionally, the computational cost of processing long sequences increases quadratically, making it challenging to extend context length. To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model. We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content. Our empirical results demonstrate that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly improves LLM's ability to manage extended contexts, making it well-suited for tasks that require both comprehensive context understanding and query relevance.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main</details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Anthropic Claude and Meta Llama, have demonstrated significant advancements across various fields of computer science research, including the automation of diverse software engineering tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex code development tasks of research projects, particularly for NLP/CV/AI/ML/DM topics, we introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for Computer Science Research projects. This benchmark assesses LLMs from various aspects including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment script quality, aiming to explore their potential in conducting computer science research autonomously. We also introduce a novel framework, CSR-Agents, that utilizes multiple LLM agents to automate the deployment of GitHub code repositories of computer science research projects. Specifically, by checking instructions from markdown files and interpreting repository structures, the model generates and iteratively improves bash commands that set up the experimental environments and deploy the code to conduct research tasks. Preliminary results from CSR-Bench indicate that LLM agents can significantly enhance the workflow of repository deployment, thereby boosting developer productivity and improving the management of developmental workflows.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

However, these models can be expensive to query in real-time and do not allow for a community-specific approach to content moderation. To address these challenges, we explore the use of open-source small language models (SLMs) for community-specific content moderation tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate SLMs (less than 15B parameters) by comparing their performance against much larger open- and closed-sourced models in both a zero-shot and few-shot setting. Using 150K comments from 15 popular Reddit communities, we find that SLMs outperform zero-shot LLMs at content moderation -- 11.5% higher accuracy and 25.7% higher recall on average across all communities. Moreover, few-shot in-context learning leads to only a marginal increase in the performance of LLMs, still lacking compared to SLMs. We further show the promise of cross-community content moderation, which has implications for new communities and the development of cross-platform moderation techniques. Finally, we outline directions for future work on language model based content moderation.

Evaluating LLMs' Ability for Conceptual Combination with Property Type](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06086v1)**<details>Conceptual combination is a cognitive process that merges basic concepts, enabling the creation of complex expressions. During this process, the properties of combination (e.g., the whiteness of a peeled apple) can be inherited from basic concepts, newly emerge, or be canceled. However, previous studies have evaluated a limited set of properties and have not examined the generative process. To address this gap, we introduce the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT), which consists of 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types. Using CCPT, we establish three types of tasks to evaluate LLMs for conceptual combination thoroughly. Our key findings are threefold: (1) Our automatic metric grading property emergence and cancellation closely corresponds with human judgments. (2) LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, struggle to generate noun phrases which possess given emergent properties.

This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate and streamline these processes. However, it remains challenging for LLMs to design novel game mechanics beyond existing databases, generate consistent gameplay environments, and develop scalable gameplay AI for large-scale evaluations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive automated card game prototyping framework. The approach highlights a graph-based indexing method for generating novel game designs, an LLM-driven system for consistent game code generation validated by gameplay records, and a gameplay AI constructing method that uses an ensemble of LLM-generated action-value functions optimized through self-play. These contributions aim to accelerate card game prototyping, reduce human labor, and lower barriers to entry for game developers.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tab</details> |
| **[Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07115v1)**<details>Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory. We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Steering LLMs With Adaptive Feature Specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22944v3)**<details>Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs) to perform arbitrary user-specified tasks, these models often still leverage spurious or biased features learned from their training data, leading to undesired behaviours when deploying them in new contexts. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>32pages, 17 figur</details> |

However, the safety of code LLMs remains under-explored, posing potential risks as insecure code generated by these models may introduce vulnerabilities into real-world systems. Previous work proposes to collect security-focused instruction-tuning dataset from real-world vulnerabilities. It is constrained by the data sparsity of vulnerable code, and has limited applicability in the iterative post-training workflows of modern LLMs. In this paper, we propose ProSec, a novel proactive security alignment approach designed to align code LLMs with secure coding practices. ProSec systematically exposes the vulnerabilities in a code LLM by synthesizing error-inducing coding scenarios from Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), and generates fixes to vulnerable code snippets, allowing the model to learn secure practices through advanced preference learning objectives. The scenarios synthesized by ProSec triggers 25 times more vulnerable code than a normal instruction-tuning dataset, resulting in a security-focused alignment dataset 7 times larger than the previous work. Experiments show that models trained with ProSec are 25.2% to 91.4% more secure compared to previous work without degrading models' utility.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</details> |

To address this concern, we present LLM Honeypot, a system designed to monitor autonomous AI hacking agents. By augmenting a standard SSH honeypot with prompt injection and time-based analysis techniques, our framework aims to distinguish LLM agents among all attackers. Over a trial deployment of about three months in a public environment, we collected 8,130,731 hacking attempts and 8 potential AI agents. Our work demonstrates the emergence of AI-driven threats and their current level of usage, serving as an early warning of malicious LLM agents in the wild.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

These varieties can affect the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, including large language models (LLMs), which are often trained on data from widely spoken varieties. This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective approach to benchmark model performance across language varieties. We argue that international online review platforms, such as Booking.com, can serve as effective data sources for constructing datasets that capture comments in different language varieties from similar real-world scenarios, like reviews for the same hotel with the same rating using the same language (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) but different language varieties (e.g., Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland Mandarin). To prove this concept, we constructed a contextually aligned dataset comprising reviews in Taiwan Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin and tested six LLMs in a sentiment analysis task. Our results show that LLMs consistently underperform in Taiwan Mandarin.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted by 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), theme track</details> |
| **[SnipGen: A Mining Repository Framework for Evaluating LLMs for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07046v1)**<details>Language Models (LLMs), such as transformer-based neural networks trained on billions of parameters, have become increasingly prevalent in software engineering (SE). These models, trained on extensive datasets that include code repositories, exhibit remarkable capabilities for SE tasks. However, evaluating their effectiveness poses significant challenges, primarily due to the potential overlap between the datasets used for training and those employed for evaluation. To address this issue, we introduce SnipGen, a comprehensive repository mining framework designed to leverage prompt engineering across various downstream tasks for code generation. SnipGen aims to mitigate data contamination by generating robust testbeds and crafting tailored data points to assist researchers and practitioners in evaluating LLMs for code-related tasks. In our exploratory study, SnipGen mined approximately 227K data points from 338K recent code changes in GitHub commits, focusing on method-level granularity. SnipGen features a collection of prompt templates that can be combined to create a Chain-of-Thought-like sequence of prompts, enabling a nuanced assessment of LLMs' code generation quality. By providing the mining tool, the methodology, and the dataset, SnipGen empowers researchers and practitioners to rigorously evaluate and interpret LLMs' performance in software engineering contexts.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tab</details> |
| **[Scalable and Ethical Insider Threat Detection through Data Synthesis and Analysis by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07045v1)**<details>Insider threats wield an outsized influence on organizations, disproportionate to their small numbers. This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>6 pages, 0 figures, 8 tab</details> |
| **[Automated Consistency Analysis of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07036v1)**<details>Generative AI (Gen AI) with large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted across the industry, academia and government. Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 3 algorithm</details> |

We then applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to these models to identify specific words associated with DIF. The data included 42,180 items designed for English language arts and mathematics summative state assessments among students in grades 3 to 11. Prediction $R^2$ ranged from .04 to .32 among eight focal and reference group pairs. Our findings suggest that many words associated with DIF reflect minor sub-domains included in the test blueprint by design, rather than construct-irrelevant item content that should be removed from assessments. This may explain why qualitative reviews of DIF items often yield confusing or inconclusive results. Our approach can be used to screen words associated with DIF during the item-writing process for immediate revision, or help review traditional DIF analysis results by highlighting key words in the text. Extensions of this research can enhance the fairness of assessment programs, especially those that lack resources to build high-quality items, and among smaller subpopulations where we do not have sufficient sample sizes for traditional DIF analyses.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>14 pages, 2 figures, 6 tab</details> |

Many biological systems solve these challenges with episodic memory, which supports single-shot learning of instance-specific contexts. Inspired by this, we present an episodic memory framework for LLM agents, centered around five key properties of episodic memory that underlie adaptive and context-sensitive behavior. With various research efforts already partially covering these properties, this position paper argues that now is the right time for an explicit, integrated focus on episodic memory to catalyze the development of long-term agents. To this end, we outline a roadmap that unites several research directions under the goal to support all five properties of episodic memory for more efficient long-term LLM agents.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |
| **[On the Emergence of Thinking in LLMs I: Searching for the Right Intuition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06773v1)**<details>Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs into LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference, taking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs. We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs? We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking. Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency. Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Abstract shortened for arXiv</details> |
| **[ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772v1)**<details>We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Traditional approaches often require detailed knowledge of a graph querying language, limiting the ability for users -- even experts -- to acquire valuable insights from KGs. LinkQ simplifies this process by implementing a multistep protocol in which the LLM interprets a user's question, then systematically converts it into a well-formed query. LinkQ helps users iteratively refine any open-ended questions into precise ones, supporting both targeted and exploratory analysis. Further, LinkQ guards against the LLM hallucinating outputs by ensuring users' questions are only ever answered from ground truth KG data. We demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ through a qualitative study with five KG practitioners. Our results indicate that practitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future LLM-assisted exploratory data analysis systems.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Open-source code: https://github.com/mit-ll/linkq</details> |
| **[Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00761v4)**<details>Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after hundreds of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that progress on tamper-resistance is possible, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Website: https://www.tamper-resistant-safeguards.com</details> |
| **[Gradient Multi-Normalization for Stateless and Scalable LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06742v1)**<details>Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers like Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) which store additional state information to accelerate convergence but incur significant memory overhead. Recent efforts, such as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for optimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a multi-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients. Motivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing stateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple norms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the normalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can produce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that SWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms, providing a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally expensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large LMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient, scalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the properties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while retaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale models. Experiments on pre-training LLaMA models with up to 1 billion parameters demonstrate a 3X speedup over Adam with significantly reduced memory requirements, outperforming other memory-efficient baselines.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

We explore two such changes: pairing questions and adding more answer options, on three benchmarks: WMDP-bio, GPQA, and MMLU variants. We find that for more capable models, these predictably reduce performance, essentially heightening the performance ceiling of a benchmark and unsaturating it again. We suggest this approach can resurrect old benchmarks.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06703v1)**<details>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted for presentation(Poster) at PPAI-25: The 6th AAAI Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligenc</details> |

Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>21 pag</details> |
| **[Automatic Evaluation of Healthcare LLMs Beyond Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06666v1)**<details>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) benchmarks are often based on open-ended or close-ended QA evaluations, avoiding the requirement of human labor. Close-ended measurements evaluate the factuality of responses but lack expressiveness. Open-ended capture the model's capacity to produce discourse responses but are harder to assess for correctness. These two approaches are commonly used, either independently or together, though their relationship remains poorly understood. This work is focused on the healthcare domain, where both factuality and discourse matter greatly. It introduces a comprehensive, multi-axis suite for healthcare LLM evaluation, exploring correlations between open and close benchmarks and metrics. Findings include blind spots and overlaps in current methodologies. As an updated sanity check, we release a new medical benchmark--CareQA--, with both open and closed variants. Finally, we propose a novel metric for open-ended evaluations --Relaxed Perplexity-- to mitigate the identified limitations.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Technical report; 31 pag</details> |

Launched in March 2024, the project aimed to train a 1-billion-parameter model on a large-scale dataset, prioritizing transparency and the sharing of practical insights to assist others in the community. The training process primarily focused on Chinese data, with a small proportion of English data included, addressing gaps in existing open-source LLMs by providing a more detailed and practical account of the model-building journey. Steel-LLM has demonstrated competitive performance on benchmarks such as CEVAL and CMMLU, outperforming early models from larger institutions.

While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

However, both approaches are computationally expensive and slow, often requiring significant resources to generate a single successful attack. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of these methods arises from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem itself. To address this gap, we approach the jailbreak problem as an alignment problem, leading us to propose LIAR (Leveraging Inference time Alignment to jailbReak), a fast and efficient best-of-N approach tailored for jailbreak attacks. LIAR offers several key advantages: it eliminates the need for additional training, operates in a fully black-box setting, significantly reduces computational overhead, and produces more human-readable adversarial prompts while maintaining competitive attack success rates. Our results demonstrate that a best-of-N approach is a simple yet highly effective strategy for evaluating the robustness of aligned LLMs, achieving attack success rates (ASR) comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a 10x improvement in perplexity and a significant speedup in Time-to-Attack, reducing execution time from tens of hours to seconds. Additionally, We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed LIAR. Our work highlights the potential of efficient, alignment-based jailbreak strategies for assessing and stress-testing AI safety measures.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |
| **[LawGPT: Knowledge-Guided Data Generation and Its Application to Legal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06572v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs), both proprietary and open-source, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. However, they face significant limitations in legal reasoning tasks. Proprietary models introduce data privacy risks and high inference costs, while open-source models underperform due to insufficient legal domain training data. To address these limitations, we study data generation for legal reasoning to improve the legal reasoning performance of open-source LLMs with the help of proprietary LLMs. This is challenging due to the lack of legal knowledge in proprietary LLMs and the difficulty in verifying the generated data. We propose KgDG, a knowledge-guided data generation framework for legal reasoning. Our framework enables leveraging legal knowledge to enhance generation diversity and introduces a refinement and verification process to ensure the quality of generated data. Moreover, we expand the generated dataset to further enhance the LLM reasoning capabilities. Using KgDG, we create a synthetic legal reasoning dataset containing 50K high-quality examples. Our trained model LawGPT outperforms existing legal-specific LLMs and achieves performance comparable to proprietary LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of KgDG and LawGPT.

Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP synthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the foundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art models may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data algorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the Private Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was designed for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our extension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance measure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of algorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries to the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not always improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established baselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the underlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more effective for this application.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

This paper presents Thought2Text, which uses instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with EEG data to achieve this goal. The approach involves three stages: (1) training an EEG encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) fine-tuning LLMs on image and text data, enabling multimodal description generation, and (3) further fine-tuning on EEG embeddings to generate text directly from EEG during inference. Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli and text captions demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMA-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Qwen2.5), validated using traditional language generation evaluation metrics, as well as fluency and adequacy measures. This approach marks a significant advancement towards portable, low-cost "thoughts-to-text" technology with potential applications in both neuroscience and natural language processing.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted to Findings of NAACL 2025</details> |

Naija is a Nigerian Pidgin spoken by approximately 120M speakers and it is a mixed language (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has mainly been a spoken language until recently, there are some online platforms (e.g., Wikipedia), publishing in written Naija as well. West African Pidgin English (WAPE) is also spoken in Nigeria and it is used by BBC to broadcast news on the internet to a wider audience not only in Nigeria but also in other West African countries (e.g., Cameroon and Ghana). Through statistical analyses and Machine Translation experiments, our paper shows that these two pidgin varieties do not represent each other (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and Generative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is underrepresented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few examples. In addition to the statistical analyses, we also provide historical information on both pidgins as well as insights from the interviews conducted with volunteer Wikipedia contributors in Naija.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (findings)</details> |

In this study, we first characterize LLM-guided conversation into three fundamental components: (i) Goal Navigation; (ii) Context Management; (iii) Empathetic Engagement, and propose GuideLLM as an installation. We then implement an interviewing environment for the evaluation of LLM-guided conversation. Specifically, various topics are involved in this environment for comprehensive interviewing evaluation, resulting in around 1.4k turns of utterances, 184k tokens, and over 200 events mentioned during the interviewing for each chatbot evaluation. We compare GuideLLM with 6 state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Llama-3-70b-Instruct, from the perspective of interviewing quality, and autobiography generation quality. For automatic evaluation, we derive user proxies from multiple autobiographies and employ LLM-as-a-judge to score LLM behaviors. We further conduct a human-involved experiment by employing 45 human participants to chat with GuideLLM and baselines. We then collect human feedback, preferences, and ratings regarding the qualities of conversation and autobiography. Experimental results indicate that GuideLLM significantly outperforms baseline LLMs in automatic evaluation and achieves consistent leading performances in human ratings.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>31 pages; the first three authors contributed equally</details> |

This paper presents KARMA, a novel framework employing multi-agent large language models (LLMs) to automate KG enrichment through structured analysis of unstructured text. Our approach employs nine collaborative agents, spanning entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution that iteratively parse documents, verify extracted knowledge, and integrate it into existing graph structures while adhering to domain-specific schema. Experiments on 1,200 PubMed articles from three different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KARMA in knowledge graph enrichment, with the identification of up to 38,230 new entities while achieving 83.1\% LLM-verified correctness and reducing conflict edges by 18.6\% through multi-layer assessments.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>24 pages, 3 figures, 2 tab</details> |

However, this personalization often relies on sensitive data, raising critical privacy concerns and necessitating data minimization. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, specifically zkVM, with LLM-based chatbots. This integration enables privacy-preserving data sharing by verifying user traits without disclosing sensitive information. Our research introduces both an architecture and a prompting strategy for this approach. Through empirical evaluation, we clarify the current constraints and performance limitations of both zkVM and the proposed prompting strategy, thereby demonstrating their practical feasibility in real-world scenarios.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted to The ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Short Paper Track</details> |

In this work, we introduce a pipeline for the generation of multilingual parallel detoxification data. We also introduce SynthDetoxM, a manually collected and synthetically generated multilingual parallel text detoxification dataset comprising 16,000 high-quality detoxification sentence pairs across German, French, Spanish and Russian. The data was sourced from different toxicity evaluation datasets and then rewritten with nine modern open-source LLMs in few-shot setting. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on the produced synthetic datasets have superior performance to those trained on the human-annotated MultiParaDetox dataset even in data limited setting. Models trained on SynthDetoxM outperform all evaluated LLMs in few-shot setting. We release our dataset and code to help further research in multilingual text detoxification.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main Conferenc</details> |
| **[How Humans Help LLMs: Assessing and Incentivizing Human Preference Annotators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06387v1)**<details>Human-annotated preference data play an important role in aligning large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we investigate the questions of assessing the performance of human annotators and incentivizing them to provide high-quality annotations. The quality assessment of language/text annotation faces two challenges: (i) the intrinsic heterogeneity among annotators, which prevents the classic methods that assume the underlying existence of a true label; and (ii) the unclear relationship between the annotation quality and the performance of downstream tasks, which excludes the possibility of inferring the annotators' behavior based on the model performance trained from the annotation data. Then we formulate a principal-agent model to characterize the behaviors of and the interactions between the company and the human annotators. The model rationalizes a practical mechanism of a bonus scheme to incentivize annotators which benefits both parties and it underscores the importance of the joint presence of an assessment system and a proper contract scheme. From a technical perspective, our analysis extends the existing literature on the principal-agent model by considering a continuous action space for the agent. We show the gap between the first-best and the second-best solutions (under the continuous action space) is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log n})$ for the binary contracts and $\Theta(1/n)$ for the linear contracts, where $n$ is the number of samples used for performance assessment; this contrasts with the known result of $\exp(-\Theta(n))$ for the binary contracts when the action space is discrete. Throughout the paper, we use real preference annotation data to accompany our discussions.</details> | 2025-02-10 |  |

However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.</details> | 2025-02-10 | <details>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</details> |

Evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11807v5)**<details>Decision-making is a complex process requiring diverse abilities, making it an excellent framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate 13 LLMs from 6 model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $69.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($65.9$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($62.4$).

To address this issue, we explore the dataset condensation for textual CBR in this paper. The goal of dataset condensation is to synthesize a small yet informative dataset, upon which models can achieve performance comparable to those trained on large datasets. While existing condensation approaches are tailored to classification tasks for continuous data like images or embeddings, direct application of them to CBR has limitations. To bridge this gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation for content-based recommendation. Inspired by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation, we leverage LLMs to empower the generation of textual content during condensation. To handle the interaction data involving both users and items, we devise a dual-level condensation method: content-level and user-level. At content-level, we utilize LLMs to condense all contents of an item into a new informative title. At user-level, we design a clustering-based synthesis module, where we first utilize LLMs to extract user interests. Then, the user interests and user embeddings are incorporated to condense users and generate interactions for condensed users. Notably, the condensation paradigm of this method is forward and free from iterative optimization on the synthesized dataset. Extensive empirical findings from our study, conducted on three authentic datasets, substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. Particularly, we are able to approximate up to 97% of the original performance while reducing the dataset size by 95% (i.e., on dataset MIND).</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>Full version of TheWebConf'25 accepted paper</details> |

The existing deployment model, which dedicates machines to each workload, simplifies SLO management but often leads to poor resource utilization. This paper introduces HyGen, an interference-aware LLM serving system that enables efficient co-location of online and offline workloads while preserving latency requirements. HyGen incorporates two key innovations: (1) performance control mechanisms, including a latency predictor to estimate batch execution time and an SLO-aware profiler to quantify latency interference, and (2) SLO-aware offline scheduling policies that maximize serving throughput and prevent starvation, without compromising online serving latency. Our evaluation on production workloads shows that HyGen achieves up to 3.87x overall throughput and 5.84x offline throughput gains over online and hybrid serving baselines, respectively, while strictly satisfying latency SLOs.</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>15 pages, 16 figur</details> |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations.

While many studies have focused on English, the safety of LLMs in Arabic, with its linguistic and cultural complexities, remains under-explored. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we present an Arab-region-specific safety evaluation dataset consisting of 5,799 questions, including direct attacks, indirect attacks, and harmless requests with sensitive words, adapted to reflect the socio-cultural context of the Arab world. To uncover the impact of different stances in handling sensitive and controversial topics, we propose a dual-perspective evaluation framework. It assesses the LLM responses from both governmental and opposition viewpoints. Experiments over five leading Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs reveal substantial disparities in their safety performance. This reinforces the need for culturally specific datasets to ensure the responsible deployment of LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>Accepted at NAACL 2025 Main Conferenc</details> |

Existing low-rank optimization methods typically project gradients onto a low-rank subspace, reducing the memory cost of storing optimizer states. A key challenge in these methods is identifying suitable subspaces to ensure an effective optimization trajectory. Most existing approaches select the dominant subspace to preserve gradient information, as this intuitively provides the best approximation. However, we find that in practice, the dominant subspace stops changing during pretraining, thereby constraining weight updates to similar subspaces. In this paper, we propose importance sampling subspace selection (I3S) for low-rank optimization, which theoretically offers a comparable convergence rate to the dominant subspace approach. Empirically, we demonstrate that I3S significantly outperforms previous methods in LLM pretraining tasks.</details> | 2025-02-09 |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>10 pag</details> |

We evaluate LLMs for bias in the personalized educational setting, specifically focusing on the models' roles as "teachers." We reveal significant biases in how models generate and select educational content tailored to different demographic groups, including race, ethnicity, sex, gender, disability status, income, and national origin. We introduce and apply two bias score metrics--Mean Absolute Bias (MAB) and Maximum Difference Bias (MDB)--to analyze 9 open and closed state-of-the-art LLMs. Our experiments, which utilize over 17,000 educational explanations across multiple difficulty levels and topics, uncover that models potentially harm student learning by both perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reversing them. We find that bias is similar for all frontier models, with the highest MAB along income levels while MDB is highest relative to both income and disability status. For both metrics, we find the lowest bias exists for sex/gender and race/ethnicity.</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>49 Pages, 55 Figures, NAACL Findings 2025</details> |

In this work, we explore LLM evaluation challenges for low-resource language understanding and introduce \proverbeval, LLM evaluation benchmark for low-resource languages, focusing on low-resource language understanding in culture-specific scenarios. We benchmark various LLMs and explore factors that create variability in the benchmarking process. We observed performance variances of up to 50\%, depending on the order in which answer choices were presented in multiple-choice tasks. Native language proverb descriptions significantly improve tasks such as proverb generation, contributing to improved outcomes. Additionally, monolingual evaluations consistently outperformed their cross-lingual counterparts in generation tasks. We argue that special attention must be given to the order of choices, the choice of prompt language, task variability, and generation tasks when creating LLM evaluation benchmarks.

Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>In Proceedings of the Conference on Applied Machine Learning in Information Security, 2024</details> |

This research systematically compares the performance of available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models (LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise compared to the baseline, they are influenced by biases such as recency and unrelated features in the text such as formality. This study highlights the necessity for improved model training and architectural adjustments to better accommodate AAE's unique linguistic characteristics.
