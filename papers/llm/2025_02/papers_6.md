| **[An Empirical Study on Challenges for LLM Application Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05002v5)**<details>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements, significantly impacting various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and software engineering. These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM application development. Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</details> |
| **[Elucidating Mechanisms of Demographic Bias in LLMs for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13319v1)**<details>We know from prior work that LLMs encode social biases, and that this manifests in clinical tasks. In this work we adopt tools from mechanistic interpretability to unveil sociodemographic representations and biases within LLMs in the context of healthcare. Specifically, we ask: Can we identify activations within LLMs that encode sociodemographic information (e.g., gender, race)? We find that gender information is highly localized in middle MLP layers and can be reliably manipulated at inference time via patching. Such interventions can surgically alter generated clinical vignettes for specific conditions, and also influence downstream clinical predictions which correlate with gender, e.g., patient risk of depression. We find that representation of patient race is somewhat more distributed, but can also be intervened upon, to a degree. To our knowledge, this is the first application of mechanistic interpretability methods to LLMs for healthcare.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Training Turn-by-Turn Verifiers for Dialogue Tutoring Agents: The Curious Case of LLMs as Your Coding Tutors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13311v1)**<details>Intelligent tutoring agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly explored to deliver personalized guidance in areas such as language learning and science education. However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students toward completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents holistically using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our results and findings can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for a variety of tasks.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[From Conversation to Automation: Leveraging LLMs for Problem-Solving Therapy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06101v2)**<details>Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a structured psychological approach that helps individuals manage stress and resolve personal issues by guiding them through problem identification, solution brainstorming, decision-making, and outcome evaluation. As mental health care increasingly adopts technologies like chatbots and large language models (LLMs), it is important to thoroughly understand how each session of PST is conducted before attempting to automate it. We developed a comprehensive framework for PST annotation using established PST Core Strategies and a set of novel Facilitative Strategies to analyze a corpus of real-world therapy transcripts to determine which strategies are most prevalent. Using various LLMs and transformer-based models, we found that GPT-4o outperformed all models, achieving the highest accuracy (0.76) in identifying all strategies. To gain deeper insights, we examined how strategies are applied by analyzing Therapeutic Dynamics (autonomy, self-disclosure, and metaphor), and linguistic patterns within our labeled data. Our research highlights LLMs' potential to automate therapy dialogue analysis, offering a scalable tool for mental health interventions. Our framework enhances PST by improving accessibility, effectiveness, and personalized support for therapists.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>18 pag</details> |
| **[HumT DumT: Measuring and controlling human-like language in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13259v1)**<details>Should LLMs generate language that makes them seem human? Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to overreliance and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs. HumT also offers insights into the impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating risks associated with anthropomorphic language generation.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Grounding LLM Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13247v1)**<details>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are valuable tools for representing relationships between entities in a structured format. Traditionally, these knowledge bases are queried to extract specific information. However, question-answering (QA) over such KGs poses a challenge due to the intrinsic complexity of natural language compared to the structured format and the size of these graphs. Despite these challenges, the structured nature of KGs can provide a solid foundation for grounding the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering organizations increased reliability and control. Recent advancements in LLMs have introduced reasoning methods at inference time to improve their performance and maximize their capabilities. In this work, we propose integrating these reasoning strategies with KGs to anchor every step or "thought" of the reasoning chains in KG data. Specifically, we evaluate both agentic and automated search methods across several reasoning strategies, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), using GRBench, a benchmark dataset for graph reasoning with domain-specific graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline models, highlighting the benefits of grounding LLM reasoning processes in structured KG data.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[SearchRAG: Can Search Engines Be Helpful for LLM-based Medical Question Answering?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13233v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains but often struggle with tasks requiring specialized knowledge. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques typically retrieve external information from static knowledge bases, which can be outdated or incomplete, missing fine-grained clinical details essential for accurate medical question answering. In this work, we propose SearchRAG, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by leveraging real-time search engines. Our method employs synthetic query generation to convert complex medical questions into search-engine-friendly queries and utilizes uncertainty-based knowledge selection to filter and incorporate the most relevant and informative medical knowledge into the LLM's input. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves response accuracy in medical question answering tasks, particularly for complex questions requiring detailed and up-to-date knowledge.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>8 pages, three figur</details> |
| **[Two Tickets are Better than One: Fair and Accurate Hiring Under Strategic LLM Manipulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13221v1)**<details>In an era of increasingly capable foundation models, job seekers are turning to generative AI tools to enhance their application materials. However, unequal access to and knowledge about generative AI tools can harm both employers and candidates by reducing the accuracy of hiring decisions and giving some candidates an unfair advantage. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variant of the strategic classification framework tailored to manipulations performed using large language models, accommodating varying levels of manipulations and stochastic outcomes. We propose a ``two-ticket'' scheme, where the hiring algorithm applies an additional manipulation to each submitted resume and considers this manipulated version together with the original submitted resume. We establish theoretical guarantees for this scheme, showing improvements for both the fairness and accuracy of hiring decisions when the true positive rate is maximized subject to a no false positives constraint. We further generalize this approach to an $n$-ticket scheme and prove that hiring outcomes converge to a fixed, group-independent decision, eliminating disparities arising from differential LLM access. Finally, we empirically validate our framework and the performance of our two-ticket scheme on real resumes using an open-source resume screening tool.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[MoBA: Mixture of Block Attention for Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13189v1)**<details>Scaling the effective context length is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the quadratic increase in computational complexity inherent in traditional attention mechanisms presents a prohibitive overhead. Existing approaches either impose strongly biased structures, such as sink or window attention which are task-specific, or radically modify the attention mechanism into linear approximations, whose performance in complex reasoning tasks remains inadequately explored. In this work, we propose a solution that adheres to the ``less structure'' principle, allowing the model to determine where to attend autonomously, rather than introducing predefined biases. We introduce Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA), an innovative approach that applies the principles of Mixture of Experts (MoE) to the attention mechanism. This novel architecture demonstrates superior performance on long-context tasks while offering a key advantage: the ability to seamlessly transition between full and sparse attention, enhancing efficiency without the risk of compromising performance. MoBA has already been deployed to support Kimi's long-context requests and demonstrates significant advancements in efficient attention computation for LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>15 pag</details> |
| **[RuozhiBench: Evaluating LLMs with Logical Fallacies and Misleading Premises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13125v1)**<details>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that they can answer questions requiring complex reasoning. However, their ability to identify and respond to text containing logical fallacies or deliberately misleading premises remains less studied. To address this gap, we introduce RuozhiBench, a bilingual dataset comprising 677 carefully curated questions that contain various forms of deceptive reasoning, meticulously crafted through extensive human effort and expert review. In a comprehensive evaluation of 17 LLMs from 5 Series over RuozhiBench using both open-ended and two-choice formats, we conduct extensive analyses on evaluation protocols and result patterns. Despite their high scores on conventional benchmarks, these models showed limited ability to detect and reason correctly about logical fallacies, with even the best-performing model, Claude-3-haiku, achieving only 62% accuracy compared to the human of more than 90%.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Adapting Psycholinguistic Research for LLMs: Gender-inclusive Language in a Coreference Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13120v1)**<details>Gender-inclusive language is often used with the aim of ensuring that all individuals, regardless of gender, can be associated with certain concepts. While psycholinguistic studies have examined its effects in relation to human cognition, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) process gender-inclusive language. Given that commercial LLMs are gaining an increasingly strong foothold in everyday applications, it is crucial to examine whether LLMs in fact interpret gender-inclusive language neutrally, because the language they generate has the potential to influence the language of their users. This study examines whether LLM-generated coreferent terms align with a given gender expression or reflect model biases. Adapting psycholinguistic methods from French to English and German, we find that in English, LLMs generally maintain the antecedent's gender but exhibit underlying masculine bias. In German, this bias is much stronger, overriding all tested gender-neutralization strategies.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ACL 2025 (ARR February 2025 cycle)</details> |
| **[MatterChat: A Multi-Modal LLM for Material Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13107v1)**<details>Understanding and predicting the properties of inorganic materials is crucial for accelerating advancements in materials science and driving applications in energy, electronics, and beyond. Integrating material structure data with language-based information through multi-modal large language models (LLMs) offers great potential to support these efforts by enhancing human-AI interaction. However, a key challenge lies in integrating atomic structures at full resolution into LLMs. In this work, we introduce MatterChat, a versatile structure-aware multi-modal LLM that unifies material structural data and textual inputs into a single cohesive model. MatterChat employs a bridging module to effectively align a pretrained machine learning interatomic potential with a pretrained LLM, reducing training costs and enhancing flexibility. Our results demonstrate that MatterChat significantly improves performance in material property prediction and human-AI interaction, surpassing general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4. We also demonstrate its usefulness in applications such as more advanced scientific reasoning and step-by-step material synthesis.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v2)**<details>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted outputs, posing a serious threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This disrupts the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the "unsafe" prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[CausalGraph2LLM: Evaluating LLMs for Causal Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15939v2)**<details>Causality is essential in scientific research, enabling researchers to interpret true relationships between variables. These causal relationships are often represented by causal graphs, which are directed acyclic graphs. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing interest in exploring their capabilities in causal reasoning and their potential use to hypothesize causal graphs. These tasks necessitate the LLMs to encode the causal graph effectively for subsequent downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce CausalGraph2LLM, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 700k queries across diverse causal graph settings to evaluate the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We categorize the causal queries into two types: graph-level and node-level queries. We benchmark both open-sourced and propriety models for our study. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise in this domain, they are highly sensitive to the encoding used. Even capable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with deviations of about $60\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for downstream causal intervention tasks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs can often display biases when presented with contextual information about a causal graph, potentially stemming from their parametric memory.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>NAACL'25 Findings, Code - https://github.com/ivaxi0s/CausalGraph2LLM</details> |
| **[LAMD: Context-driven Android Malware Detection and Classification with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13055v1)**<details>The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier. Evaluation in real-world settings demonstrates LAMD's effectiveness over conventional detectors, establishing a feasible basis for LLM-driven malware analysis in dynamic threat landscapes.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Thoughts Are All Over the Place: On the Underthinking of o1-Like LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18585v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and exhibiting human-like deep thinking. However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. Our findings contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>1. We have updated the results for DeepSeek-R1, and all of our original conclusions remain valid. 2. Our proposed Tip approach remains effective in Best-of-N scenarios (e.g., self-consistency and Laconic Decoding) when built on DeepSeek-R1</details> |
| **[HPSS: Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search for LLM Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13031v1)**<details>Since the adoption of large language models (LLMs) for text evaluation has become increasingly prevalent in the field of natural language processing (NLP), a series of existing works attempt to optimize the prompts for LLM evaluators to improve their alignment with human judgment. However, their efforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts, such as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the evaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting strategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To this end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and propose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm, HPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for LLM evaluators. A heuristic function is employed to guide the search process, enhancing the performance of our algorithm. Extensive experiments across four evaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently outperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic prompt optimization methods.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>32 pages, 10 figur</details> |
| **[PeerArg: Argumentative Peer Review with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16813v2)**<details>Peer review is an essential process to determine the quality of papers submitted to scientific conferences or journals. However, it is subjective and prone to biases. Several studies have been conducted to apply techniques from NLP to support peer review, but they are based on black-box techniques and their outputs are difficult to interpret and trust. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to support and understand the reviewing and decision-making processes of peer review: the PeerArg system combining LLMs with methods from knowledge representation. PeerArg takes in input a set of reviews for a paper and outputs the paper acceptance prediction. We evaluate the performance of the PeerArg pipeline on three different datasets, in comparison with a novel end-2-end LLM that uses few-shot learning to predict paper acceptance given reviews. The results indicate that the end-2-end LLM is capable of predicting paper acceptance from reviews, but a variant of the PeerArg pipeline outperforms this LLM.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Presented at NeLaMKRR@KR, 2024 (arXiv:2410.05339)</details> |
| **[LLM-Powered Proactive Data Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13016v1)**<details>With the power of LLMs, we now have the ability to query data that was previously impossible to query, including text, images, and video. However, despite this enormous potential, most present-day data systems that leverage LLMs are reactive, reflecting our community's desire to map LLMs to known abstractions. Most data systems treat LLMs as an opaque black box that operates on user inputs and data as is, optimizing them much like any other approximate, expensive UDFs, in conjunction with other relational operators. Such data systems do as they are told, but fail to understand and leverage what the LLM is being asked to do (i.e. the underlying operations, which may be error-prone), the data the LLM is operating on (e.g., long, complex documents), or what the user really needs. They don't take advantage of the characteristics of the operations and/or the data at hand, or ensure correctness of results when there are imprecisions and ambiguities. We argue that data systems instead need to be proactive: they need to be given more agency -- armed with the power of LLMs -- to understand and rework the user inputs and the data and to make decisions on how the operations and the data should be represented and processed. By allowing the data system to parse, rewrite, and decompose user inputs and data, or to interact with the user in ways that go beyond the standard single-shot query-result paradigm, the data system is able to address user needs more efficiently and effectively. These new capabilities lead to a rich design space where the data system takes more initiative: they are empowered to perform optimization based on the transformation operations, data characteristics, and user intent. We discuss various successful examples of how this framework has been and can be applied in real-world tasks, and present future directions for this ambitious research agenda.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Adaptive Knowledge Graphs Enhance Medical Question Answering: Bridging the Gap Between LLMs and Evolving Medical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13010v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Adaptive Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries. Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Beyond Profile: From Surface-Level Facts to Deep Persona Simulation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12988v1)**<details>Previous approaches to persona simulation large language models (LLMs) have typically relied on learning basic biographical information, or using limited role-play dialogue datasets to capture a character's responses. However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought processes of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. We hope that this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLM.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>19 pages, 3 figur</details> |

We also deliver a comprehensive cookbook on how to develop the multilingual model in an efficient manner, including five key aspects: data curation, pre-training, post-training, model customization and evaluation. We hope that Sailor2 model (Apache 2.0 license) will drive language development in the SEA region, and Sailor2 cookbook will inspire researchers to build more inclusive LLMs for other under-served languages.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>49 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Distinguishing Ignorance from Error in LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22071v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations -- factually incorrect outputs -- leading to a large body of work on detecting and mitigating such cases. We argue that it is important to distinguish between two types of hallucinations: ones where the model does not hold the correct answer in its parameters, which we term HK-, and ones where the model answers incorrectly despite having the required knowledge, termed HK+. We first find that HK+ hallucinations are prevalent and occur across models and datasets. Then, we demonstrate that distinguishing between these two cases is beneficial for mitigating hallucinations. Importantly, we show that different models hallucinate on different examples, which motivates constructing model-specific hallucination datasets for training detectors. Overall, our findings draw attention to classifying types of hallucinations and provide means to handle them more effectively. The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/hallucination-mitigation .</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

Prior research has associated hallucinations with model uncertainty, leveraging this relationship for hallucination detection and mitigation. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that all hallucinations are associated with uncertainty. Using knowledge detection and uncertainty measurement methods, we demonstrate that models can hallucinate with high certainty even when they have the correct knowledge. We further show that high-certainty hallucinations are consistent across models and datasets, distinctive enough to be singled out, and challenge existing mitigation methods. Our findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety. The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/Trust_me_Im_wrong .</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Infinite Retrieval: Attention Enhanced LLMs in Long-Context Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12962v1)**<details>Limited by the context window size of Large Language Models(LLMs), handling various tasks with input tokens exceeding the upper limit has been challenging, whether it is a simple direct retrieval task or a complex multi-hop reasoning task. Although various methods have been proposed to enhance the long-context processing capabilities of LLMs, they either incur substantial post-training costs, or require additional tool modules(e.g.,RAG), or have not shown significant improvement in realistic tasks. Our work observes the correlation between the attention distribution and generated answers across each layer, and establishes the attention allocation aligns with retrieval-augmented capabilities through experiments. Drawing on the above insights, we propose a novel method InfiniRetri that leverages the LLMs's own attention information to enable accurate retrieval across inputs of infinitely length. Our evaluations indicate that InfiniRetri achieves 100% accuracy in the Needle-In-a-Haystack(NIH) test over 1M tokens using a 0.5B parameter model, surpassing other method or larger models and setting a new state-of-the-art(SOTA). Moreover, our method achieves significant performance improvements on real-world benchmarks, with a maximum 288% improvement. In addition, InfiniRetri can be applied to any Transformer-based LLMs without additional training and substantially reduces inference latency and compute overhead in long texts. In summary, our comprehensive studies show InfiniRetri's potential for practical applications and creates a paradigm for retrievaling information using LLMs own capabilities under infinite-length tokens. Code will be released in link.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>21 pag</details> |
| **[RevisEval: Improving LLM-as-a-Judge via Response-Adapted References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05193v2)**<details>With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation quality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

The rise of high-quality AI-generated content has spurred interest in AI-driven micro-video creation. However, despite the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in text generation and reasoning, their potential to assist the creation of popular micro-videos remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content. Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation. This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities. We will release the code and datasets to support future studies.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Can You Trust LLM Judgments? Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12509v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, but their stochastic nature poses challenges to the reliability of their outputs. While deterministic settings can improve consistency, they do not guarantee reliability, as a single sample from the model's probability distribution can still be misleading. Building upon the concept of LLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the reliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the reliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard single-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact of temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the limitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple samples, which we show has significant implications for downstream applications. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on single-shot evaluations. This work provides a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and reliable LLM-based systems and applications.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[ToxiLab: How Well Do Open-Source LLMs Generate Synthetic Toxicity Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15175v3)**<details>Effective toxic content detection relies heavily on high-quality and diverse data, which serve as the foundation for robust content moderation models. Synthetic data has become a common approach for training models across various NLP tasks. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain for highly subjective tasks like hate speech detection, with previous research yielding mixed results. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data synthesis, utilizing controlled prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques to enhance data quality and diversity. We systematically evaluated 6 open source LLMs on 5 datasets, assessing their ability to generate diverse, high-quality harmful data while minimizing hallucination and duplication. Our results show that Mistral consistently outperforms other open models, and supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances data reliability and diversity. We further analyze the trade-offs between prompt-based vs. fine-tuned toxic data synthesis, discuss real-world deployment challenges, and highlight ethical considerations. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned open source LLMs provide scalable and cost-effective solutions to augment toxic content detection datasets, paving the way for more accessible and transparent content moderation tools.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>14 pag</details> |
| **[Flow-of-Options: Diversified and Improved LLM Reasoning by Thinking Through Options](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12929v1)**<details>We present a novel reasoning approach called Flow-of-Options (FoO), designed to address intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). FoO enables LLMs to systematically explore a diverse range of possibilities in their reasoning, as demonstrated by an FoO-based agentic system for autonomously solving Machine Learning tasks (AutoML). Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 38.2% - 69.2% on standard data science tasks, and 37.4% - 47.9% on therapeutic chemistry tasks. With an overall operation cost under $1 per task, our framework is well-suited for cost-sensitive applications. Beyond classification and regression, we illustrate the broader applicability of our FoO-based agentic system to tasks such as reinforcement learning and image generation. Our framework presents significant advancements compared to current state-of-the-art agentic systems for AutoML, due to the benefits of FoO in enforcing diversity in LLM solutions through compressed, explainable representations that also support long-term memory when combined with case-based reasoning.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Github code: https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Option</details> |
| **[Conditioning LLMs to Generate Code-Switched Text: A Methodology Grounded in Naturally Occurring Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12924v1)**<details>Code-switching (CS) is still a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and generate code-switched text, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale CS datasets for training. This paper presents a novel methodology to generate CS data using LLMs, and test it on the English-Spanish language pair. We propose back-translating natural CS sentences into monolingual English, and using the resulting parallel corpus to fine-tune LLMs to turn monolingual sentences into CS. Unlike previous approaches to CS generation, our methodology uses natural CS data as a starting point, allowing models to learn its natural distribution beyond grammatical patterns. We thoroughly analyse the models' performance through a study on human preferences, a qualitative error analysis and an evaluation with popular automatic metrics. Results show that our methodology generates fluent code-switched text, expanding research opportunities in CS communication, and that traditional metrics do not correlate with human judgement when assessing the quality of the generated CS data. We release our code and generated dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[On-Device LLMs for Home Assistant: Dual Role in Intent Detection and Response Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12923v1)**<details>This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuned on synthetic but domain-representative data, can perform the twofold task of (i) slot and intent detection and (ii) natural language response generation for a smart home assistant, while running solely on resource-limited, CPU-only edge hardware. We fine-tune LLMs to produce both JSON action calls and text responses. Our experiments show that 16-bit and 8-bit quantized variants preserve high accuracy on slot and intent detection and maintain strong semantic coherence in generated text, while the 4-bit model, while retaining generative fluency, suffers a noticeable drop in device-service classification accuracy. Further evaluations on noisy human (non-synthetic) prompts and out-of-domain intents confirm the models' generalization ability, obtaining around 80--86\% accuracy. While the average inference time is 5--6 seconds per query -- acceptable for one-shot commands but suboptimal for multi-turn dialogue -- our results affirm that an on-device LLM can effectively unify command interpretation and flexible response generation for home automation without relying on specialized hardware.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Query Rewriting via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12918v1)**<details>Query rewriting is a classical technique for transforming complex declarative SQL queries into ``lean'' equivalents that are conducive to (a) faster execution from a performance perspective, and (b) better understanding from a developer perspective. The rewriting is typically achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system. In recent times, LLM-based techniques have also been mooted, but they are prone to both semantic and syntactic errors. We investigate here, how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency. Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths. Further, a suite of statistical and logic-based tools can be used to guard against errors produced by the model. We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from multiple benchmarks on contemporary database platforms. The results show significant improvements over SOTA rewriting techniques -- for instance, on TPC-DS, LITHE constructed productive (>1.5x speedup) rewrites for \emph{two-thirds} of the query suite, delivering four times more coverage than SOTA. Further, the geometric mean of its estimated execution speedups was an \emph{order-of-magnitude} jump over SOTA performance. In essence, LITHE offers a potent and robust LLM-based intermediary between enterprise applications and database engines.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to FP16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing memory usage (50%). Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12911v1)**<details>Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose an enhanced schema linking metric by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Agent (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking agent designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilize a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potential redundant ones.With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA text-to-SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

Fraud-R1 comprises 8,564 fraud cases sourced from phishing scams, fake job postings, social media, and news, categorized into 5 major fraud types. Unlike previous benchmarks, Fraud-R1 introduces a multi-round evaluation pipeline to assess LLMs' resistance to fraud at different stages, including credibility building, urgency creation, and emotional manipulation. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 LLMs under two settings: 1. Helpful-Assistant, where the LLM provides general decision-making assistance, and 2. Role-play, where the model assumes a specific persona, widely used in real-world agent-based interactions. Our evaluation reveals the significant challenges in defending against fraud and phishing inducement, especially in role-play settings and fake job postings. Additionally, we observe a substantial performance gap between Chinese and English, underscoring the need for improved multilingual fraud detection capabilities.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

We focus on two fundamental problems between speech and text: the representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency. We propose Soundwave, which utilizes an efficient training strategy and a novel architecture to address these issues. Results show that Soundwave outperforms the advanced Qwen2-Audio in speech translation and AIR-Bench speech tasks, using only one-fiftieth of the training data. Further analysis shows that Soundwave still retains its intelligence during conversation. The project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Soundwave.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[None of the Others: a General Technique to Distinguish Reasoning from Memorization in Multiple-Choice LLM Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12896v1)**<details>In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

User diversity may come about among others due to i) age differences; ii) gender characteristics, and/or iii) multilingual experience, and associated differences in language processing and use.

| **[Second-Order Fine-Tuning without Pain for LLMs:A Hessian Informed Zeroth-Order Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15173v4)**<details>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with classic first-order optimizers entails prohibitive GPU memory due to the backpropagation process. Recent works have turned to zeroth-order optimizers for fine-tuning, which save substantial memory by using two forward passes. However, these optimizers are plagued by the heterogeneity of parameter curvatures across different dimensions. In this work, we propose HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer which is the first work to leverage the diagonal Hessian to enhance zeroth-order optimizer for fine-tuning LLMs. What's more, HiZOO avoids the expensive memory cost and only increases one forward pass per step. Extensive experiments on various models (350M~66B parameters) indicate that HiZOO improves model convergence, significantly reducing training steps and effectively enhancing model accuracy. Moreover, we visualize the optimization trajectories of HiZOO on test functions, illustrating its effectiveness in handling heterogeneous curvatures. Lastly, we provide theoretical proofs of convergence for HiZOO. Code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiZOO27F8.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

However, existing approaches to incentivize LLMs' deep thinking abilities generally require large-scale data or significant training efforts. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how to improve the thinking abilities of less powerful base models. In this work, we introduce S$^2$R, an efficient framework that enhances LLM reasoning by teaching models to self-verify and self-correct during inference. Specifically, we first initialize LLMs with iterative self-verification and self-correction behaviors through supervised fine-tuning on carefully curated data. The self-verification and self-correction skills are then further strengthened by both outcome-level and process-level reinforcement learning, with minimized resource requirements, enabling the model to adaptively refine its reasoning process during inference. Our results demonstrate that, with only 3.1k self-verifying and self-correcting behavior initialization samples, Qwen2.5-math-7B achieves an accuracy improvement from 51.0\% to 81.6\%, outperforming models trained on an equivalent amount of long-CoT distilled data. Extensive experiments and analysis based on three base models across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks validate the effectiveness of S$^2$R.

| **[Towards Adaptive Feedback with AI: Comparing the Feedback Quality of LLMs and Teachers on Experimentation Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12842v1)**<details>Effective feedback is essential for fostering students' success in scientific inquiry. With advancements in artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for delivering instant and adaptive feedback. However, this feedback often lacks the pedagogical validation provided by real-world practitioners. To address this limitation, our study evaluates and compares the feedback quality of LLM agents with that of human teachers and science education experts on student-written experimentation protocols. Four blinded raters, all professionals in scientific inquiry and science education, evaluated the feedback texts generated by 1) the LLM agent, 2) the teachers and 3) the science education experts using a five-point Likert scale based on six criteria of effective feedback: Feed Up, Feed Back, Feed Forward, Constructive Tone, Linguistic Clarity, and Technical Terminology. Our results indicate that LLM-generated feedback shows no significant difference to that of teachers and experts in overall quality. However, the LLM agent's performance lags in the Feed Back dimension, which involves identifying and explaining errors within the student's work context. Qualitative analysis highlighted the LLM agent's limitations in contextual understanding and in the clear communication of specific errors. Our findings suggest that combining LLM-generated feedback with human expertise can enhance educational practices by leveraging the efficiency of LLMs and the nuanced understanding of educators.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>This work has been submitted to the IJAIED for possible publication</details> |
| **[An LLM-Powered Agent for Physiological Data Analysis: A Case Study on PPG-based Heart Rate Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12836v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnosis, patient care, and decision support through interactive communication. More recently, they have been applied to analyzing physiological time-series like wearable data for health insight extraction. Existing methods embed raw numerical sequences directly into prompts, which exceeds token limits and increases computational costs. Additionally, some studies integrated features extracted from time-series in textual prompts or applied multimodal approaches. However, these methods often produce generic and unreliable outputs due to LLMs' limited analytical rigor and inefficiency in interpreting continuous waveforms. In this paper, we develop an LLM-powered agent for physiological time-series analysis aimed to bridge the gap in integrating LLMs with well-established analytical tools. Built on the OpenCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, our agent features an orchestrator that integrates user interaction, data sources, and analytical tools to generate accurate health insights. To evaluate its effectiveness, we implement a case study on heart rate (HR) estimation from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using a dataset of PPG and Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in a remote health monitoring study. The agent's performance is benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, with ECG serving as the gold standard for HR estimation. Results demonstrate that our agent significantly outperforms benchmark models by achieving lower error rates and more reliable HR estimations. The agent implementation is publicly available on GitHub.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

One recent advancement in the realm of penetration testing is the utilization of Language Models (LLMs). We explore the intersection of LLMs and penetration testing to gain insight into their capabilities and challenges in the context of privilege escalation. We introduce a fully automated privilege-escalation tool designed for evaluating the efficacy of LLMs for (ethical) hacking, executing benchmarks using multiple LLMs, and investigating their respective results. Our results show that GPT-4-turbo is well suited to exploit vulnerabilities (33-83% of vulnerabilities). GPT-3.5-turbo can abuse 16-50% of vulnerabilities, while local models, such as Llama3, can only exploit between 0 and 33% of the vulnerabilities. We analyze the impact of different context sizes, in-context learning, optional high-level guidance mechanisms, and memory management techniques. We discuss challenging areas for LLMs, including maintaining focus during testing, coping with errors, and finally comparing LLMs with human hackers. The current version of the LLM-guided privilege-escalation prototype can be found at https://github.com/ipa-labs/hackingBuddyGPT.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

We present Optima, a novel framework that addresses these issues by significantly enhancing both communication efficiency and task effectiveness in LLM-based MAS through LLM training. Optima employs an iterative generate, rank, select, and train paradigm with a reward function balancing task performance, token efficiency, and communication readability. We explore various RL algorithms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and their hybrid approaches, providing insights into their effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. We integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired techniques for DPO data generation, treating conversation turns as tree nodes to explore diverse interaction paths. Evaluated on common multi-agent tasks, including information-asymmetric question answering and complex reasoning, Optima shows consistent and substantial improvements over single-agent baselines and vanilla MAS based on Llama 3 8B, achieving up to 2.8x performance gain with less than 10\% tokens on tasks requiring heavy information exchange. Moreover, Optima's efficiency gains open new possibilities for leveraging inference-compute more effectively, leading to improved inference-time scaling laws. By addressing fundamental challenges in LLM-based MAS, Optima shows the potential towards scalable, efficient, and effective MAS (https://chenweize1998.github.io/optima-project-page).</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Under review</details> |

However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls.

However, current LLM inference systems, optimized for shared memory architectures like GPUs, fail to fully exploit these accelerators. We introduce WaferLLM, the first wafer-scale LLM inference system. WaferLLM is guided by a novel PLMR model (pronounced as "Plummer") that captures the unique hardware characteristics of wafer-scale architectures. Leveraging this model, WaferLLM pioneers wafer-scale LLM parallelism, optimizing the utilization of hundreds of thousands of on-chip cores. It also introduces MeshGEMM and MeshGEMV, the first GEMM and GEMV implementations designed to scale effectively on wafer-scale accelerators. Evaluations show that WaferLLM achieves 200$\times$ better wafer-scale accelerator utilization than state-of-the-art systems. On a commodity wafer-scale accelerator, WaferLLM delivers 606$\times$ faster and 22$\times$ more energy-efficient GEMV compared to an advanced GPU. For LLMs, based on 16-bit data type, WaferLLM achieves 2700 toks/sec/req decode speed on Llama3-8B model and 840 toks/sec/req decode speed on Qwen2-72B model, which enables 39$\times$ faster decoding with 1.7$\times$ better energy efficiency.

Crucially, such LLMs need to ground their generations in any feedback obtained to reliably achieve the desired outcomes. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning method for teaching models to leverage execution feedback in the realm of code synthesis, where state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to improve code iteratively compared to independent sampling. We benchmark on competitive programming tasks, where we achieve new state-of-the art results with both small (8B parameters) and large (70B) models while reducing the amount of samples required by an order of magnitude. Our analysis of inference-time behavior demonstrates that our method produces LLMs that effectively leverage automatic feedback over multiple steps.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Add repair model ablation, update related work</details> |

Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining strategy (FRAME), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAME achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random across MMLU and CMMLU for the 3B model, effectively boosting LLM performance.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

On Multilingual Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12769v1)**<details>In the age of misinformation, hallucination -- the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate non-factual or unfaithful responses -- represents the main risk for their global utility. Despite LLMs becoming increasingly multilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM hallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT) and summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open information seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM hallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question answering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model and conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM families. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on MT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually annotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for these languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between silver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data for estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates estimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with LLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while LLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for higher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized hallucination rates of languages and their digital representation. Further, we find that smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination rates than larger models.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Under Review</details> |
| **["I know myself better, but not really greatly": Using LLMs to Detect and Explain LLM-Generated Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12743v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating human-like texts, but the potential misuse of such LLM-generated texts raises the need to distinguish between human-generated and LLM-generated content. This paper explores the detection and explanation capabilities of LLM-based detectors of LLM-generated texts, in the context of a binary classification task (human-generated texts vs LLM-generated texts) and a ternary classification task (human-generated texts, LLM-generated texts, and undecided). By evaluating on six close/open-source LLMs with different sizes, our findings reveal that while self-detection consistently outperforms cross-detection, i.e., LLMs can detect texts generated by themselves more accurately than those generated by other LLMs, the performance of self-detection is still far from ideal, indicating that further improvements are needed. We also show that extending the binary to the ternary classification task with a new class "Undecided" can enhance both detection accuracy and explanation quality, with improvements being statistically significant and consistent across all LLMs. We finally conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses on the explanation errors, which are categorized into three types: reliance on inaccurate features (the most frequent error), hallucinations, and incorrect reasoning. These findings with our human-annotated dataset emphasize the need for further research into improving both self-detection and self-explanation, particularly to address overfitting issues that may hinder generalization.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Under review</details> |

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in platforms like Open AI's ChatGPT, coupled with their cost-effectiveness and high-quality results, has led to their rapid adoption among university students. However, discerning genuine student input from LLM-generated output poses a challenge for lecturers. This dilemma jeopardizes the trust relationship between lecturers and students, potentially impacting university downstream activities, particularly collaborative research initiatives. Despite attempts to establish guidelines for student LLM use, a clear framework mutually beneficial for lecturers and students in higher education remains elusive. This study addresses the research question: How does the use of LLMs by students impact Informational and Procedural Justice, influencing Team Trust and Expected Team Performance? Methodically, we applied a quantitative construct-based survey, evaluated using techniques of Structural Equation Modelling (PLS- SEM) to examine potential relationships among these constructs. Our findings based on 23 valid respondents from Ndejje University indicate that lecturers are less concerned about the fairness of LLM use per se but are more focused on the transparency of student utilization, which significantly influences Team Trust positively. This research contributes to the global discourse on integrating and regulating LLMs and subsequent models in education. We propose that guidelines should support LLM use while enforcing transparency in Lecturer-Student- Collaboration to foster Team Trust and Performance. The study contributes valuable insights for shaping policies enabling ethical and transparent LLMs usage in education to ensure effectiveness of collaborative learning environments.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[Effective Self-Mining of In-Context Examples for Unsupervised Machine Translation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11006v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, primarily through in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, the LLM is provided with examples that represent a given task such that it learns to generate answers for test inputs. However, access to these in-context examples is not guaranteed especially for low-resource or massively multilingual tasks. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach to mine in-context examples for machine translation (MT), enabling unsupervised MT (UMT) across different languages. Our approach begins with word-level mining to acquire word translations that are then used to perform sentence-level mining. As the quality of mined parallel pairs may not be optimal due to noise or mistakes, we introduce a filtering criterion to select the optimal in-context examples from a pool of unsupervised parallel sentences. We evaluate our approach using two multilingual LLMs on 288 directions from the FLORES-200 dataset and analyze the impact of various linguistic features on performance. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our unsupervised approach in mining in-context examples for MT, leading to better or comparable translation performance as translation with regular in-context samples (extracted from human-annotated data), while also outperforming the other state-of-the-art UMT methods by an average of $7$ BLEU points.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Accepted at NAACL 2025</details> |

Existing methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning to enhance tool-use capabilities, treating tool learning as a text-generation task while overlooking the decision-making complexities inherent in multi-step contexts. In this work, we propose modeling tool learning as a dynamic decision-making task and introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework that enhances the multi-step tool use capabilities of LLMs. StepTool consists of two main components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards at each tool interaction based on the success of tool invocation and its contribution to the task; and Step-grained Optimization, which uses policy gradient methods to optimize the model in a multi-step manner. Experimental results demonstrate that StepTool significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-step, tool-based tasks, offering a robust solution for tool learning.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Ongoning Work</details> |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs do Visual Temporal Understanding and Reasoning? The answer is No!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10674v2)**<details>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advancements in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) by leveraging foundational Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their abilities in specific areas such as visual temporal understanding, which is crucial for comprehending real-world dynamics, remain underexplored. To address this, we propose a challenging evaluation benchmark named TemporalVQA, consisting of two parts: 1) Temporal Order Understanding and 2) Time-lapse Estimation. The first part requires MLLMs to determine the sequence of events by analyzing temporally consecutive video frames. The second part presents image pairs with varying time differences, framed as multiple-choice questions, asking MLLMs to estimate the time-lapse between images with options ranging from seconds to years. Our evaluations of advanced MLLMs, including models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, reveal significant challenges: GPT-4o achieved only 49.1% average consistent accuracy in temporal order task and 70% in time-lapse estimation, with open-source models performing even poorly. These findings underscore the limitations of current MLLMs in visual temporal understanding and reasoning, highlighting the need for further improvements for their temporal capability.

Existing privacy attacks primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII) in LLM's training data remains challenging. In this paper, we propose R.R. (Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII entities have been masked. In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in masks. Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates. In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and rank them. Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model as a calibration to our criterion. Experiments across three popular PII datasets demonstrate that the R.R. achieves better PII identical performance compared to baselines. These results highlight the vulnerability of LLMs to PII leakage even when training data has been scrubbed. We release the replicate package of R.R. at a link.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>13 pages, 9 figur</details> |

Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>NAACL 2025</details> |

Our study evaluates bias in smaller-scale Llama and Gemma models using the SALT ($\textbf{S}$ocial $\textbf{A}$ppropriateness in $\textbf{L}$LM-Generated $\textbf{T}$ext) dataset, which incorporates five distinct bias triggers: General Debate, Positioned Debate, Career Advice, Problem Solving, and CV Generation. To quantify bias, we measure win rates in General Debate and the assignment of negative roles in Positioned Debate. For real-world use cases, such as Career Advice, Problem Solving, and CV Generation, we anonymize the outputs to remove explicit demographic identifiers and use DeepSeek-R1 as an automated evaluator. We also address inherent biases in LLM-based evaluation, including evaluation bias, positional bias, and length bias, and validate our results through human evaluations. Our findings reveal consistent polarization across models, with certain demographic groups receiving systematically favorable or unfavorable treatment. By introducing SALT, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for bias analysis and underscore the need for robust bias mitigation strategies in the development of equitable AI systems.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

An Exploration of Iterative Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10858v2)**<details>Deep iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables LLMs to tackle complex tasks by progressively activating relevant pre-trained knowledge. However, it faces challenges in ensuring continual improvement and determining a stopping criterion. In this paper, we investigate whether the relevant knowledge that contributes directly to solving the given question can be activated from the initial reasoning path, thus circumventing the need for iterative refinement. Our experiments reveal that increasing the diversity of initial reasoning paths can achieve comparable or superior performance, a concept we term \textit{breadth reasoning}. However, existing breadth reasoning approaches, such as self-consistency, offer limited diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances reasoning breadth by integrating contextual exploration with reduced sampling randomness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms deep iterative reasoning.

However, they continue to face challenges such as hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs. These issues can be mitigated through in-context learning by providing LLMs with relevant context before generating answers. Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Accepted for publication in NAACL 2025.

These challenges are often exacerbated by misinformation caused by lack of verification, reasoning without attribution, and potential knowledge conflicts. We propose LongFaith, a novel pipeline for synthesizing faithful long-context reasoning instruction datasets. By integrating ground truth and citation-based reasoning prompts, we eliminate distractions and improve the accuracy of reasoning chains, thus mitigating the need for costly verification processes. We open-source two synthesized datasets, LongFaith-SFT and LongFaith-PO, which systematically address multiple dimensions of faithfulness, including verified reasoning, attribution, and contextual grounding. Extensive experiments on multi-hop reasoning datasets and LongBench demonstrate that models fine-tuned on these datasets significantly improve performance. Our ablation studies highlight the scalability and adaptability of the LongFaith pipeline, showcasing its broad applicability in developing long-context LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

Extending the context length has disproportionately shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during inference to the key-value cache (KV cache). In this paper, we propose HEADINFER, which offloads the KV cache to CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for any transformer layer on the GPU. HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise offloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the GPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we demonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while significantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the Llama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory footprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage from 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline inference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B model on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without approximation methods.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>Code: https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgen</details> |

Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, existing studies predominantly focus on white-box attacks, leaving black-box scenarios underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS (AutoDoS) attack, an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs. AutoDoS constructs the DoS Attack Tree and expands the node coverage to achieve effectiveness under black-box conditions. By transferability-driven iterative optimization, AutoDoS could work across different models in one prompt. Furthermore, we reveal that embedding the Length Trojan allows AutoDoS to bypass existing defenses more effectively. Experimental results show that AutoDoS significantly amplifies service response latency by over 250$\times\uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage. Our work provides a new perspective on LLM-DoS attacks and security defenses.

While the "personification" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM-Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human subject study. Our system features an LLM-Agent module and a universal browser connector module so that UX researchers can automatically generate thousands of simulated users to test the target website. The results are shown in qualitative (e.g., interviewing how an agent thinks ), quantitative (e.g., # of actions), and video recording formats for UX researchers to analyze. Through a heuristic user evaluation with five UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent-assisted UX study.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |

While existing semantic vector-based compression methods achieve promising performance, these methods fail to account for the intrinsic information density variations between context chunks, instead allocating soft tokens uniformly across context chunks. This uniform distribution inevitably diminishes allocation to information-critical regions. To address this, we propose Dynamic Allocation of Soft Tokens (DAST), a simple yet effective method that leverages the LLM's intrinsic understanding of contextual relevance to guide compression. DAST combines perplexity-based local information with attention-driven global information to dynamically allocate soft tokens to the informative-rich chunks, enabling effective, context-aware compression. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DAST surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

Traditional alignment methods, relying on human or LLM annotated datasets, are limited by their resource-intensive nature, inherent subjectivity, misalignment with real-world user preferences, and the risk of feedback loops that amplify model biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WildFeedback, a novel framework that leverages in-situ user feedback during conversations with LLMs to create preference datasets automatically. Given a corpus of multi-turn user-LLM conversation, WildFeedback identifies and classifies user feedback to LLM responses between conversation turns. The user feedback is then used to create examples of preferred and dispreferred responses according to users' preference. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on WildFeedback dataset exhibit significantly improved alignment with user preferences, as evidenced by both traditional benchmarks and our proposed checklist-guided evaluation. By incorporating in-situ feedback from actual users, WildFeedback addresses the scalability, subjectivity, and bias challenges that plague existing approaches, marking a significant step toward developing LLMs that are more responsive to the diverse and evolving needs of their users.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>24 pag</details> |

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

However, they continue to face challenges such as hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs. These issues can be mitigated through in-context learning by providing LLMs with relevant context before generating answers. Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

This paper explores the role of personas in the creation of ESC by LLMs. Our research utilizes established psychological frameworks to measure and infuse persona traits into LLMs, which then generate dialogues in the emotional support scenario. We conduct extensive evaluations to understand the stability of persona traits in dialogues, examining shifts in traits post-generation and their impact on dialogue quality and strategy distribution. Experimental results reveal several notable findings: 1) LLMs can infer core persona traits, 2) subtle shifts in emotionality and extraversion occur, influencing the dialogue dynamics, and 3) the application of persona traits modifies the distribution of emotional support strategies, enhancing the relevance and empathetic quality of the responses. These findings highlight the potential of persona-driven LLMs in crafting more personalized, empathetic, and effective emotional support dialogues, which has significant implications for the future design of AI-driven emotional support systems.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

A Case Study on Entity Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11441v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Work in Progr</details> |

While previous research has primarily focused on refining instruction components and augmenting input data with in-context examples, our work investigates the potential benefits of optimizing the input data itself. We introduce a two-pronged strategy for input data optimization: content engineering and structural reformulation. Content engineering involves imputing missing values, removing irrelevant attributes, and enriching profiles by generating additional information inferred from existing attributes. Subsequent to content engineering, structural reformulation is applied to optimize the presentation of the modified content to LLMs, given their sensitivity to input format. Our findings suggest that these optimizations can significantly improve the performance of LLMs in various tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research in prompt engineering.

However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose \textsc{FLAG-Trader}, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
| **[FRAMES: Boosting LLMs with A Four-Quadrant Multi-Stage Pretraining Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05551v2)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced human language understanding and generation, with pretraining data quality and organization being crucial to their performance. Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining strategy (FRAME), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAME achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random across MMLU and CMMLU for the 3B model, effectively boosting LLM performance.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

However, recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for research idea generation often overlooks these theoretical foundations. We present a framework that explicitly implements combinatorial creativity theory using LLMs, featuring a generalization-level retrieval system for cross-domain knowledge discovery and a structured combinatorial process for idea generation. The retrieval system maps concepts across different abstraction levels to enable meaningful connections between disparate domains, while the combinatorial process systematically analyzes and recombines components to generate novel solutions. Experiments on the OAG-Bench dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, consistently outperforming baseline approaches in generating ideas that align with real research developments (improving similarity scores by 7\%-10\% across multiple metrics). Our results provide strong evidence that LLMs can effectively realize combinatorial creativity when guided by appropriate theoretical frameworks, contributing both to practical advancement of AI-assisted research and theoretical understanding of machine creativity.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

Our real-world measurements show that both server-based and on-device deployments struggle to meet diverse QoE demands: server deployments face high costs and last-hop issues (e.g., Internet latency and dynamics), while on-device LLM inference is constrained by resources. We introduce DiSCo, a device-server cooperative scheduler designed to optimize users' QoE by adaptively routing requests and migrating response generation between endpoints while maintaining cost constraints. DiSCo employs cost-aware scheduling, leveraging the predictable speed of on-device LLM inference with the flexible capacity of server-based inference to dispatch requests on the fly, while introducing a token-level migration mechanism to ensure consistent token delivery during migration. Evaluations on real-world workloads -- including commercial services like OpenAI GPT and DeepSeek, and open-source deployments such as LLaMA3 -- show that DiSCo can improve users' QoE by reducing tail TTFT (11-52\%) and mean TTFT (6-78\%) across different model-device configurations, while dramatically reducing serving costs by up to 84\% through its migration mechanism while maintaining comparable QoE levels.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>17 pages, 14 figur</details> |

For many LLMs, translating in and out of low-resource languages remains a challenging task. To maximize data efficiency in this low-resource setting, we introduce Mufu, which includes a selection of automatically generated multilingual candidates and an instruction to correct inaccurate translations in the prompt. Mufu prompts turn a translation task into a postediting one, and seek to harness the LLM's reasoning capability with auxiliary translation candidates, from which the model is required to assess the input quality, align the semantics cross-lingually, copy from relevant inputs and override instances that are incorrect. Our experiments on En-XX translations over the Flores-200 dataset show LLMs finetuned against Mufu-style prompts are robust to poor quality auxiliary translation candidates, achieving performance superior to NLLB 1.3B distilled model in 64% of low- and very-low-resource language pairs. We then distill these models to reduce inference cost, while maintaining on average 3.1 chrF improvement over finetune-only baseline in low-resource translations.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>29 pag</details> |
| **[Bag of Tricks for Inference-time Computation of LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07191v4)**<details>With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), solving complex reasoning tasks has gained increasing attention. Inference-time computation methods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as they can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or requiring additional training. However, these techniques come with implementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the proof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their computational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark diverse inference-time computation strategies across reasoning tasks of varying complexity. Since most current methods rely on a proposer-verifier pipeline that first generates candidate solutions (e.g., reasoning solutions) and then selects the best one based on reward signals (e.g., RLHF rewards, process rewards), our research focuses on optimizing both candidate solution generation (e.g., instructing prompts, hyperparameters such as temperature and top-p) and reward mechanisms (e.g., self-evaluation, reward types). Through extensive experiments (more than 20,000 A100-80G GPU hours with over 1,000 experiments) across a variety of models (e.g., Llama, Qwen, and Mistral families) of various sizes, our ablation studies reveal that previously overlooked strategies can significantly enhance performance (e.g., tuning temperature can improve reasoning task performance by up to 5%). Furthermore, we establish a standardized benchmark for inference-time computation by systematically evaluating six representative methods across eight reasoning tasks. These findings provide a stronger foundation for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/benchmark_inference_time_computation_LLM</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

Traditional fusion methods either merge model parameters directly or rely on knowledge distillation with rigid assumptions, limiting their flexibility and efficiency. InfiFusion overcomes these limitations by enhancing Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) with Top-K selection and Logits Standardization. We propose two fusion strategies: Pairwise Fusion (InfiFusion$_p$), where each source model knowledge is distilled individually into the pivot model followed by merging and Unified Fusion (InfiFusion$_u$), where knowledge from all source models is distilled simultaneously into the pivot model. InfiFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art models, such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4, across 11 widely applied benchmarks covering reasoning, coding, mathematics, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, InfiFusion achieves this superior performance while significantly reduces computational costs, completing full training with only 160 H800 GPU hours compared to the millions typically required for traditional LLM training.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Significant performance improvements over the previous version; under review;</details> |
| **[FB-Bench: A Fine-Grained Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Responsiveness to Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09412v2)**<details>Human feedback is crucial in the interactions between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing research primarily focuses on benchmarking LLMs in single-turn dialogues. Even in benchmarks designed for multi-turn dialogues, the user inputs are often independent, neglecting the nuanced and complex nature of human feedback within real-world usage scenarios. To fill this research gap, we introduce FB-Bench, a fine-grained, multi-task benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' responsiveness to human feedback under real-world usage scenarios in Chinese. Drawing from the two main interaction scenarios, FB-Bench comprises 591 meticulously curated samples, encompassing eight task types, five deficiency types of response, and nine feedback types. We extensively evaluate a broad array of popular LLMs, revealing significant variations in their performance across different interaction scenarios. Further analysis indicates that task, human feedback, and deficiencies of previous responses can also significantly impact LLMs' responsiveness. Our findings underscore both the strengths and limitations of current models, providing valuable insights and directions for future research. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/PKU-Baichuan-MLSystemLab/FB-Bench.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
| **[Following the Autoregressive Nature of LLM Embeddings via Compression and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11401v1)**<details>A new trend uses LLMs as dense text encoders via contrastive learning. However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Industry</details> |

Do these models truly understand commonsense knowledge, or just memorize expression patterns? To investigate this question, we present the first extensive robustness evaluation of LLMs in commonsense reasoning. We introduce HellaSwag-Pro, a large-scale bilingual benchmark consisting of 11,200 cases, by designing and compiling seven types of question variants. To construct this benchmark, we propose a two-stage method to develop Chinese HellaSwag, a finely annotated dataset comprising 12,000 instances across 56 categories. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 representative LLMs, revealing that these LLMs are far from robust in commonsense reasoning. Furthermore, this robustness varies depending on the language in which the LLM is tested. This work establishes a high-quality evaluation benchmark, with extensive experiments offering valuable insights to the community in commonsense reasoning for LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Under Review</details> |

As the problem has not been thoroughly examined yet, this study examines identity consistency across nine LLMs. Specifically, we (1) investigate whether LLMs could maintain consistent patterns (or identity) and (2) analyze the effect of the model family, parameter sizes, and provided persona types. Our experiments involve multi-turn conversations on personal themes, analyzed in qualitative and quantitative ways. Experimental results indicate three findings. (1) Larger models experience greater identity drift. (2) Model differences exist, but their effect is not stronger than parameter sizes. (3) Assigning a persona may not help to maintain identity. We hope these three findings can help to improve persona stability in AI-driven dialogue systems, particularly in long-term conversations.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Under review</details> |

Word embeddings, combined with a similarity metric, provide an effective approach to constructing such a space. Typically, embeddings are derived from traditional distributed models or encoder-only pretrained models, whose objectives directly capture the meaning of the current token. In contrast, decoder-only models, including large language models (LLMs), predict the next token, making their embeddings less directly tied to the current token's semantics. Moreover, comparative studies on LLMs of different scales remain underexplored. In this paper, we construct a conceptual space using word embeddings from LLMs of varying scales and comparatively analyze their properties. We establish a network based on a linguistic typology-inspired connectivity hypothesis, examine global statistical properties, and compare LLMs of varying scales. Locally, we analyze conceptual pairs, WordNet relations, and a cross-lingual semantic network for qualitative words. Our results indicate that the constructed space exhibits small-world properties, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and short path lengths. Larger LLMs generate more intricate spaces, with longer paths reflecting richer relational structures and connections. Furthermore, the network serves as an efficient bridge for cross-lingual semantic mapping.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Paper under review</details> |
| **[Predicting the Performance of Black-box LLMs through Self-Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01558v2)**<details>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied on in AI systems, predicting when they make mistakes is crucial. While a great deal of work in the field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these representations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an API. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using follow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as representations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate that training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces reliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance level (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question). Remarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate over a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In addition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate more nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be used to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that has been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers question-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code. Furthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model architectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of GPT-4o-mini).</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>28 pag</details> |

Using a corpus of literature reviews written by L2 graduate students and assessed by human experts against 9 analytic criteria, we prompt several popular LLMs to perform the same task under various conditions. To evaluate the quality of feedback comments, we apply a novel feedback comment quality evaluation framework. This framework is interpretable, cost-efficient, scalable, and reproducible, compared to existing methods that rely on manual judgments. We find that LLMs can generate reasonably good and generally reliable multi-dimensional analytic assessments.

Yet its quadratic complexity hinders efficiency and scalability, especially for long-context processing. A promising approach is to leverage sparsity in attention. However, existing sparsity-based solutions predominantly rely on predefined patterns or heuristics at the attention head level, struggling to adapt dynamically to different contexts efficiently. We propose SeerAttention, a simple yet effective attention mechanism that directly learns the block-level attention sparsity from the LLM itself. Inspired by the gating mechanism in Mixture of Experts (MoE), SeerAttention augments the conventional attention with a learnable gate that selectively activates important blocks within the attention map. Specifically, the gate first pools the query (Q) and key (K) tensors along the sequence dimension and processes them through learnable linear layers. The resulting matrices are then multiplied together to produce the gating scores, which are used to predict block-level attention sparsity. Combined with our block-sparse FlashAttention kernel, SeerAttention can achieve significant speedup on GPUs. When applied to pre-trained LLMs, SeerAttention only requires training the gate parameters in a lightweight self-distillation manner, allowing rapid convergence. Our evaluation results demonstrate that SeerAttention achieves better model accuracy and lower latency for long-context pre-filling compared to prior methods.

However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while existing manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to $\textit{positive}$ prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a $\textit{happy ending}$, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request.This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two turns to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79\% attack success rate on average. We also provide quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

Adversaries can inject malicious commands through compromised tools, manipulating LLMs to send sensitive information to these tools, which leads to potential privacy breaches. However, existing attack approaches are black-box oriented and rely on static commands that cannot adapt flexibly to the changes in user queries and the invocation chain of tools. It makes malicious commands more likely to be detected by LLM and leads to attack failure. In this paper, we propose AutoCMD, a dynamic attack comment generation approach for information theft attacks in LLM tool-learning systems. Inspired by the concept of mimicking the familiar, AutoCMD is capable of inferring the information utilized by upstream tools in the toolchain through learning on open-source systems and reinforcement with target system examples, thereby generating more targeted commands for information theft. The evaluation results show that AutoCMD outperforms the baselines with +13.2% $ASR_{Theft}$, and can be generalized to new tool-learning systems to expose their information leakage risks. We also design four defense methods to effectively protect tool-learning systems from the attack.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>15 pages, 11 figur</details> |

Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. We will release our code upon request.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>Our code will be available at https://github.com/pillowsofwind/LLM-CBRN-Risk</details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various D2T tasks, previous studies on scaling laws have primarily focused on generalization error through power law scaling to LLM size (i.e., the number of model parameters). However, no research has examined the impact of LLM size on factual inconsistency in D2T. In this paper, we investigate how factual inconsistency in D2T scales with LLM size by exploring two scaling laws: power law and exponential scaling. To rigorously evaluate and compare these scaling laws, we employ a statistical validation framework consisting of three key stages: predictive performance estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, and comparative analysis. For a comprehensive empirical study, we analyze three popular LLM families across five D2T datasets, measuring factual inconsistency inversely using four state-of-the-art consistency metrics. Our findings, based on exhaustive empirical results and validated through our framework, reveal that, contrary to the widely assumed power law scaling, factual inconsistency in D2T follows an exponential scaling with LLM size.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>21 pag</details> |

In this work, we are the first to investigate the impact of real-world SDCs on LLM training by comparing model training between healthy production nodes and unhealthy nodes exhibiting SDCs. With the help from a cloud computing platform, we access the unhealthy nodes that were swept out from production by automated fleet management. Using deterministic execution via XLA compiler and our proposed synchronization mechanisms, we isolate and analyze the impact of SDC errors on these nodes at three levels: at each submodule computation, at a single optimizer step, and at a training period. Our results reveal that the impact of SDCs on computation varies on different unhealthy nodes. Although in most cases the perturbations from SDCs on submodule computation and gradients are relatively small, SDCs can lead models to converge to different optima with different weights and even cause spikes in the training loss. Our analysis sheds light on further understanding and mitigating the impact of SDCs.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
| **[From Dense to Dynamic: Token-Difficulty Driven MoEfication of Pre-Trained LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12325v1)**<details>Training large language models (LLMs) for different inference constraints is computationally expensive, limiting control over efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Moreover, once trained, these models typically process tokens uniformly, regardless of their complexity, leading to static and inflexible behavior. In this paper, we introduce a post-training optimization framework, DynaMoE, that adapts a pre-trained dense LLM to a token-difficulty-driven Mixture-of-Experts model with minimal fine-tuning cost. This adaptation makes the model dynamic, with sensitivity control to customize the balance between efficiency and accuracy. DynaMoE features a token-difficulty-aware router that predicts the difficulty of tokens and directs them to the appropriate sub-networks or experts, enabling larger experts to handle more complex tokens and smaller experts to process simpler ones. Our experiments demonstrate that DynaMoE can generate a range of adaptive model variants of the existing trained LLM with a single fine-tuning step, utilizing only $10B$ tokens, a minimal cost compared to the base model's training. Each variant offers distinct trade-offs between accuracy and performance. Compared to the baseline post-training optimization framework, Flextron, our method achieves similar aggregated accuracy across downstream tasks, despite using only $\frac{1}{9}\text{th}$ of their fine-tuning cost.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |

This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
