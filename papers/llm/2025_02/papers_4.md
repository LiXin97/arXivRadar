| **[A Training-free LLM-based Approach to General Chinese Character Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15266v1)**<details>Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a crucial task that aims to correct character errors in Chinese text. While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our method enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times larger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>25 pages, 12 figur</details> |
| **[PiCO: Peer Review in LLMs based on the Consistency Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01830v3)**<details>Existing large language models (LLMs) evaluation methods typically focus on testing the performance on some closed-environment and domain-specific benchmarks with human annotations. In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evaluation direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM's response score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models, we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking. We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the consistency of each LLM's capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is that high-level LLM can evaluate others' answers more accurately than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover, we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[A General Pseudonymization Framework for Cloud-Based LLMs: Replacing Privacy Information in Controlled Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15233v1)**<details>An increasing number of companies have begun providing services that leverage cloud-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. However, this development raises substantial privacy concerns, as users' prompts are transmitted to and processed by the model providers. Among the various privacy protection methods for LLMs, those implemented during the pre-training and fine-tuning phrases fail to mitigate the privacy risks associated with the remote use of cloud-based LLMs by users. On the other hand, methods applied during the inference phrase are primarily effective in scenarios where the LLM's inference does not rely on privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we outline the process of remote user interaction with LLMs and, for the first time, propose a detailed definition of a general pseudonymization framework applicable to cloud-based LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework strikes an optimal balance between privacy protection and utility. The code for our method is available to the public at https://github.com/Mebymeby/Pseudonymization-Framework.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>under review</details> |
| **[User Experience with LLM-powered Conversational Recommendation Systems: A Case of Music Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15229v1)**<details>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) now allows users to actively interact with conversational recommendation systems (CRS) and build their own personalized recommendation services tailored to their unique needs and goals. This experience offers users a significantly higher level of controllability compared to traditional RS, enabling an entirely new dimension of recommendation experiences. Building on this context, this study explored the unique experiences that LLM-powered CRS can provide compared to traditional RS. Through a three-week diary study with 12 participants using custom GPTs for music recommendations, we found that LLM-powered CRS can (1) help users clarify implicit needs, (2) support unique exploration, and (3) facilitate a deeper understanding of musical preferences. Based on these findings, we discuss the new design space enabled by LLM-powered CRS and highlight its potential to support more personalized, user-driven recommendation experiences.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on LLM Bias and Toxicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12566v2)**<details>With the different roles that AI is expected to play in human life, imbuing large language models (LLMs) with different personalities has attracted increasing research interests. While the "personification" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Understand User Opinions of Large Language Models via LLM-Powered In-the-Moment User Experience Interviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15226v1)**<details>Which large language model (LLM) is better? Every evaluation tells a story, but what do users really think about current LLMs? This paper presents CLUE, an LLM-powered interviewer that conducts in-the-moment user experience interviews, right after users interacted with LLMs, and automatically gathers insights about user opinions from massive interview logs. We conduct a study with thousands of users to understand user opinions on mainstream LLMs, recruiting users to first chat with a target LLM and then interviewed by CLUE. Our experiments demonstrate that CLUE captures interesting user opinions, for example, the bipolar views on the displayed reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 and demands for information freshness and multi-modality. Our collected chat-and-interview logs will be released.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[Auto-Bench: An Automated Benchmark for Scientific Discovery in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15224v1)**<details>Given the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important question arises: Can LLMs conduct human-like scientific research and discover new knowledge, and act as an AI scientist? Scientific discovery is an iterative process that demands efficient knowledge updating and encoding. It involves understanding the environment, identifying new hypotheses, and reasoning about actions; however, no standardized benchmark specifically designed for scientific discovery exists for LLM agents. In response to these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, \textit{Auto-Bench}, that encompasses necessary aspects to evaluate LLMs for scientific discovery in both natural and social sciences. Our benchmark is based on the principles of causal graph discovery. It challenges models to uncover hidden structures and make optimal decisions, which includes generating valid justifications. By engaging interactively with an oracle, the models iteratively refine their understanding of underlying interactions, the chemistry and social interactions, through strategic interventions. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini, Qwen, Claude, and Llama, and observe a significant performance drop as the problem complexity increases, which suggests an important gap between machine and human intelligence that future development of LLMs need to take into consideration.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>13 pag</details> |
| **[FormalSpecCpp: A Dataset of C++ Formal Specifications created using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15217v1)**<details>FormalSpecCpp is a dataset designed to fill the gap in standardized benchmarks for verifying formal specifications in C++ programs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive collection of C++ programs with well-defined preconditions and postconditions. It provides a structured benchmark for evaluating specification inference tools and testing theaccuracy of generated specifications. Researchers and developers can use this dataset to benchmark specification inference tools,fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated specification generation, and analyze the role of formal specifications in improving program verification and automated testing. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to advance research in program verification, specification inference, and AI-assisted software development. The dataset and the code are available at https://github.com/MadhuNimmo/FormalSpecCpp.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/ACM 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)</details> |
| **[AQUA: Network-Accelerated Memory Offloading for LLMs in Scale-Up GPU Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21255v3)**<details>Inference on large-language models (LLMs) is constrained by GPU memory capacity. A sudden increase in the number of inference requests to a cloud-hosted LLM can deplete GPU memory, leading to contention between multiple prompts for limited resources. Modern LLM serving engines deal with the challenge of limited GPU memory using admission control, which causes them to be unresponsive during request bursts. We propose that preemptive scheduling of prompts in time slices is essential for ensuring responsive LLM inference, especially under conditions of high load and limited GPU memory. However, preempting prompt inference incurs a high paging overhead, which reduces inference throughput. We present Aqua, a GPU memory management framework that significantly reduces the overhead of paging inference state, achieving both responsive and high-throughput inference even under bursty request patterns. We evaluate Aqua by hosting several state-of-the-art large generative ML models of different modalities on servers with 8 Nvidia H100 80G GPUs. Aqua improves the responsiveness of LLM inference by 20X compared to the state-of-the-art and improves LLM inference throughput over a single long prompt by 4X.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[BP-GPT: Auditory Neural Decoding Using fMRI-prompted LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15172v1)**<details>Decoding language information from brain signals represents a vital research area within brain-computer interfaces, particularly in the context of deciphering the semantic information from the fMRI signal. Although existing work uses LLM to achieve this goal, their method does not use an end-to-end approach and avoids the LLM in the mapping of fMRI-to-text, leaving space for the exploration of the LLM in auditory decoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, the Brain Prompt GPT (BP-GPT). By using the brain representation that is extracted from the fMRI as a prompt, our method can utilize GPT-2 to decode fMRI signals into stimulus text. Further, we introduce the text prompt and align the fMRI prompt to it. By introducing the text prompt, our BP-GPT can extract a more robust brain prompt and promote the decoding of pre-trained LLM. We evaluate our BP-GPT on the open-source auditory semantic decoding dataset and achieve a significant improvement up to 4.61 on METEOR and 2.43 on BERTScore across all the subjects compared to the state-of-the-art method. The experimental results demonstrate that using brain representation as a prompt to further drive LLM for auditory neural decoding is feasible and effective. The code is available at https://github.com/1994cxy/BP-GPT.</details> | 2025-02-21 | <details>rXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.07840</details> |
| **[Are Smarter LLMs Safer? Exploring Safety-Reasoning Trade-offs in Prompting and Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09673v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various NLP benchmarks. However, excelling in complex tasks that require nuanced reasoning and precise decision-making demands more than raw language proficiency--LLMs must reason, i.e., think logically, draw from past experiences, and synthesize information to reach conclusions and take action. To enhance reasoning abilities, approaches such as prompting and fine-tuning have been widely explored. While these methods have led to clear improvements in reasoning, their impact on LLM safety remains less understood. In this work, we investigate the interplay between reasoning and safety in LLMs. We highlight the latent safety risks that arise as reasoning capabilities improve, shedding light on previously overlooked vulnerabilities. At the same time, we explore how reasoning itself can be leveraged to enhance safety, uncovering potential mitigation strategies. By examining both the risks and opportunities in reasoning-driven LLM safety, our study provides valuable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more trustworthy in real-world deployments.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[RLTHF: Targeted Human Feedback for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13417v2)**<details>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align with user preferences is challenging due to the high cost of quality human annotations in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the generalizability limitations of AI Feedback. To address these challenges, we propose RLTHF, a human-AI hybrid framework that combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human annotations to achieve full-human annotation alignment with minimal effort. RLTHF identifies hard-to-annotate samples mislabeled by LLMs using a reward model's reward distribution and iteratively enhances alignment by integrating strategic human corrections while leveraging LLM's correctly labeled samples. Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that RLTHF reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort. Furthermore, models trained on RLTHF's curated datasets for downstream tasks outperform those trained on fully human-annotated datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of RLTHF's strategic data curation.</details> | 2025-02-21 |  |
| **[MIR-Bench: Benchmarking LLM's Long-Context Intelligence via Many-Shot In-Context Inductive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09933v2)**<details>Inductive Reasoning (IR), the ability to summarize rules from examples and apply on new ones, has long been viewed as a primal ability for general intelligence and widely studied by cognitive science and AI researchers. Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually $<$10) setting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts. On the other hand, the ever-growing context length of LLMs have brought forth the novel paradigm of many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), which addresses new tasks with hundreds to thousands of examples without expensive and inefficient fine-tuning. However, many-shot evaluations are mostly focused on classification (a very limited aspect of IR), and popular long-context LLM tasks such as Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) seldom require complicated intelligence for integrating many pieces of information. To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot in-context inductive reasoning benchmark that asks LLM to induce output via input-output examples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for inductive reasoning and many-shot ICL, including robustness against erroneous shots and the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and acquired insightful findings.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>32 pages, 11 figures. v2 updated the project page and dataset link</details> |
| **[Using tournaments to calculate AUROC for zero-shot classification with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15018v1)**<details>Large language models perform surprisingly well on many zero-shot classification tasks, but are difficult to fairly compare to supervised classifiers due to the lack of a modifiable decision boundary. In this work, we propose and evaluate a method that converts binary classification tasks into pairwise comparison tasks, obtaining relative rankings from LLMs. Repeated pairwise comparisons can be used to score instances using the Elo rating system (used in chess and other competitions), inducing a confidence ordering over instances in a dataset. We evaluate scheduling algorithms for their ability to minimize comparisons, and show that our proposed algorithm leads to improved classification performance, while also providing more information than traditional zero-shot classification.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Contextualizing Search Queries In-Context Learning for Conversational Rewriting with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15009v1)**<details>Conversational query rewriting is crucial for effective conversational search, yet traditional supervised methods require substantial labeled data, which is scarce in low-resource settings. This paper introduces Prompt-Guided In-Context Learning, a novel approach that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot conversational query rewriting. Our method employs carefully designed prompts, incorporating task descriptions, input/output format specifications, and a small set of illustrative examples, to guide pre-trained LLMs to generate context-independent queries without explicit fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, TREC and Taskmaster-1, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including supervised models and contrastive co-training methods, across various evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE-L, Success Rate, and MRR. Ablation studies confirm the importance of in-context examples, and human evaluations further validate the superior fluency, relevance, and context utilization of our generated rewrites. The results highlight the potential of prompt-guided in-context learning as an efficient and effective paradigm for low-resource conversational query rewriting, reducing the reliance on extensive labeled data and complex training procedures.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[From Human Annotation to LLMs: SILICON Annotation Workflow for Management Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14461v2)**<details>Unstructured text data annotation and analysis are fundamental to management research, often relying on human annotators through crowdsourcing platforms. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to human annotation, there lacks a systematic workflow that evaluate when LLMs are suitable or how to proceed with LLM-based text annotation in a reproducible manner. This paper addresses this methodological gap by introducing the ``SILICON" (Systematic Inference with LLMs for Information Classification and Notation) workflow. The workflow integrates established principles of human annotation with systematic prompt optimization and model selection, addressing challenges such as developing robust annotation guidelines, establishing high-quality human baselines, optimizing prompts, and ensuring reproducibility across LLMs. We validate the SILICON workflow through seven case studies covering common management research tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of validating annotation guideline agreement, the superiority of expert-developed human baselines over crowdsourced ones, the iterative nature of prompt optimization, and the necessity of testing multiple LLMs. We also find that LLMs agree well with expert annotations in most cases but show low agreement in more complex multi-label classification tasks. Notably, we propose a regression-based methodology to empirically compare LLM outputs across prompts and models. Our workflow advances management research by establishing rigorous, transparent, and reproducible processes for LLM-based annotation. We provide practical guidance for researchers to effectively navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI tools.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[AlphaPO -- Reward shape matters for LLM alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03884v3)**<details>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made huge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is skipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being learned. Some popular examples of DAAs include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responses are often reduced undesirably. In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce \textbf{AlphaPO}, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter to help change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and over-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO leads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance for the instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B while achieving 15\% to 50\% relative improvement over DPO on the same models. The analysis and results presented highlight the importance of the reward shape, and how one can systematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improve alignment performance.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14866v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Accepted by MLSys 2025. Code available at: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserv</details> |
| **[Aligning LLMs to Ask Good Questions A Case Study in Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14860v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) often fail to ask effective questions under uncertainty, making them unreliable in domains where proactive information-gathering is essential for decisionmaking. We present ALFA, a framework that improves LLM question-asking by (i) decomposing the notion of a "good" question into a set of theory-grounded attributes (e.g., clarity, relevance), (ii) controllably synthesizing attribute-specific question variations, and (iii) aligning models via preference-based optimization to explicitly learn to ask better questions along these fine-grained attributes. Focusing on clinical reasoning as a case study, we introduce the MediQ-AskDocs dataset, composed of 17k real-world clinical interactions augmented with 80k attribute-specific preference pairs of follow-up questions, as well as a novel expert-annotated interactive healthcare QA task to evaluate question-asking abilities. Models aligned with ALFA reduce diagnostic errors by 56.6% on MediQ-AskDocs compared to SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs, with a question-level win-rate of 64.4% and strong generalizability. Our findings suggest that explicitly guiding question-asking with structured, fine-grained attributes offers a scalable path to improve LLMs, especially in expert application domains.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>22 pages, 8 figures, 8 tab</details> |
| **[Red-Teaming LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Communication Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14847v1)**<details>Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14837v1)**<details>Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>16 pages, 8 figur</details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752v2)**<details>Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Middle-Layer Representation Alignment for Cross-Lingual Transfer in Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14830v1)**<details>While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/dannigt/mid-align).</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Fundamental Limitations in Defending LLM Finetuning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14828v1)**<details>LLM developers have imposed technical interventions to prevent fine-tuning misuse attacks, attacks where adversaries evade safeguards by fine-tuning the model using a public API. Previous work has established several successful attacks against specific fine-tuning API defences. In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Large Language Models Struggle to Describe the Haystack without Human Help: Human-in-the-loop Evaluation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14748v1)**<details>A common use of NLP is to facilitate the understanding of large document collections, with a shift from using traditional topic models to Large Language Models. Yet the effectiveness of using LLM for large corpus understanding in real-world applications remains under-explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with unsupervised, supervised LLM-based exploratory approaches or traditional topic models on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human-readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to the LLM generation process improves data exploration by mitigating hallucination and over-genericity but requires greater human effort. In contrast, traditional. models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly. We show that LLMs struggle to describe the haystack of large corpora without human help, particularly domain-specific data, and face scaling and hallucination limitations due to context length constraints.

| **[SuperGPQA: Scaling LLM Evaluation across 285 Graduate Disciplines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14739v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[LLM4TS: Aligning Pre-Trained LLMs as Data-Efficient Time-Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08469v6)**<details>Multivariate time-series forecasting is vital in various domains, e.g., economic planning and weather prediction. Deep train-from-scratch models have exhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits real-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the representation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However, incorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited adaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic data, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the time-series alignment stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data, and the forecasting fine-tuning stage for downstream time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7 time-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods compared with trained-from-scratch models in full-shot scenarios, and also achieves the highest rank in few-shot scenarios. In addition, evaluations compared with different unsupervised representation learning approaches highlight LLM4TS's effectiveness with representation learning in forecasting tasks. Ablation studies further validate each component's contribution to LLM4TS and underscore the essential role of utilizing LLM's pre-trained weights for optimal performance.

| **[How to Get Your LLM to Generate Challenging Problems for Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14678v1)**<details>The pace of evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates new approaches for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Traditional human annotation is increasingly impracticable due to the complexities and costs involved in generating high-quality, challenging problems. In this work, we introduce CHASE, a unified framework to synthetically generate challenging problems using LLMs without human involvement. For a given task, our approach builds a hard problem in a bottom-up manner from simpler components. Moreover, our framework decomposes the generation process into independently verifiable sub-tasks, thereby ensuring a high level of quality and correctness. We implement CHASE to create evaluation benchmarks across three diverse domains: (1) document-based question answering, (2) repository-level code completion, and (3) math reasoning. The performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on these synthetic benchmarks lies in the range of 40-60% accuracy, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework at generating challenging problems. We publicly release our benchmarks and code.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure. To this end, we first construct four recommendation datasets, denoted as $\dataset$, along with user instructions for each record.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>WWW2025@HCRS</details> |

Local newspapers balance coverage across regions, yet identifying local articles is challenging due to implicit location cues like slang or landmarks. Traditional methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graphs, infer locations, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities while raising concerns about accuracy and explainability. This paper explores LLMs for local article classification in Taboola's "Homepage For You" system, comparing them to traditional techniques. Key findings: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models' ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration. Offline evaluations showed LLMs excel at implicit location classification, while online A/B tests showed a significant increased in local views. A scalable pipeline integrating LLM-based location classification boosted local article distribution by 27%, preserving newspapers' brand identity and enhancing homepage personalization.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>10 pages, 2 figures, submitted to k</details> |

However, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or basic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge synchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical state-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE), designed to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages effectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition Instruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel dataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information, and (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies advanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages, fostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality, cross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer across languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks show that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an average improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual settings.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[How Far are LLMs from Being Our Digital Twins? A Benchmark for Persona-Based Behavior Chain Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14642v1)**<details>Recently, LLMs have garnered increasing attention across academic disciplines for their potential as human digital twins, virtual proxies designed to replicate individuals and autonomously perform tasks such as decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning on their behalf. However, current evaluations of LLMs primarily emphasize dialogue simulation while overlooking human behavior simulation, which is crucial for digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce BehaviorChain, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate continuous human behavior. BehaviorChain comprises diverse, high-quality, persona-based behavior chains, totaling 15,846 distinct behaviors across 1,001 unique personas, each with detailed history and profile metadata. For evaluation, we integrate persona metadata into LLMs and employ them to iteratively infer contextually appropriate behaviors within dynamic scenarios provided by BehaviorChain. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrated that even state-of-the-art models struggle with accurately simulating continuous human behavior.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[CER: Confidence Enhanced Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14634v1)**<details>Ensuring the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios that demand precise mathematical calculations and knowledge-intensive open-domain generation. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware framework designed to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by systematically incorporating model confidence at critical decision points. We propose an approach that encourages multi-step reasoning in LLMs and quantify the confidence of intermediate answers such as numerical results in mathematical reasoning and proper nouns in open-domain generation. Then, the overall confidence of each reasoning chain is evaluated based on confidence of these critical intermediate steps. Finally, we aggregate the answer of generated response paths in a way that reflects the reliability of each generated content (as opposed to self-consistency in which each generated chain contributes equally to majority voting). We conducted extensive experiments in five datasets, three mathematical datasets and two open-domain datasets, using four LLMs. The results consistently validate the effectiveness of our novel confidence aggregation method, leading to an accuracy improvement of up to 7.4% and 5.8% over baseline approaches in math and open-domain generation tasks, respectively. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ Aquasar11/CER.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[PEARL: Towards Permutation-Resilient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14628v1)**<details>The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations. However, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to instability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be exploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect - that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the demonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing and fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations, raising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance against the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a permutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most challenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which is solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax optimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other, progressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic pre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL effectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably, despite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves performance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>ICLR 2025</details> |

However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge.

| **[Serving Models, Fast and Slow:Optimizing Heterogeneous LLM Inferencing Workloads at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14617v1)**<details>Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads handled by global cloud providers can include both latency-sensitive and insensitive tasks, creating a diverse range of Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Managing these mixed workloads is challenging due to the complexity of the inference stack, which includes multiple LLMs, hardware configurations, and geographic distributions. Current optimization strategies often silo these tasks to ensure that SLAs are met for latency-sensitive tasks, but this leads to significant under-utilization of expensive GPU resources despite the availability of spot and on-demand Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning. We propose SAGESERVE, a comprehensive LLM serving framework that employs adaptive control knobs at varying time scales, ensuring SLA compliance while maximizing the utilization of valuable GPU resources. Short-term optimizations include efficient request routing to data center regions, while long-term strategies involve scaling GPU VMs out/in and redeploying models to existing VMs to align with traffic patterns. These strategies are formulated as an optimization problem for resource allocation and solved using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform empirical and simulation studies based on production workload traces with over 8M requests using four open-source models deployed across three regions. SAGESERVE achieves up to 25% savings in GPU-hours while maintaining tail latency and satisfying all SLOs, and it reduces the scaling overhead compared to baselines by up to 80%, confirming the effectiveness of our proposal. In terms of dollar cost, this can save cloud providers up to $2M over the course of a month.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>15 pages, 17 figures, 2 tab</details> |
| **[BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11844v2)**<details>The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

To address these limitations, we propose TeLL-Drive, a hybrid framework that integrates a Teacher LLM to guide an attention-based Student DRL policy. By incorporating risk metrics, historical scenario retrieval, and domain heuristics into context-rich prompts, the LLM produces high-level driving strategies through chain-of-thought reasoning. A self-attention mechanism then fuses these strategies with the DRL agent's exploration, accelerating policy convergence and boosting robustness across diverse driving conditions. The experimental results, evaluated across multiple traffic scenarios, show that TeLL-Drive outperforms existing baseline methods, including other LLM-based approaches, in terms of success rates, average returns, and real-time feasibility. Ablation studies underscore the importance of each model component, especially the synergy between the attention mechanism and LLM-driven guidance. Finally, we build a virtual-real fusion experimental platform to verify the real-time performance, robustness, and reliability of the algorithm running on real vehicles through vehicle-in-loop experiments.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Plan-over-Graph: Towards Parallelable LLM Agent Schedule](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14563v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in reasoning for task planning. However, challenges remain under-explored for parallel schedules. This paper introduces a novel paradigm, plan-over-graph, in which the model first decomposes a real-life textual task into executable subtasks and constructs an abstract task graph. The model then understands this task graph as input and generates a plan for parallel execution. To enhance the planning capability of complex, scalable graphs, we design an automated and controllable pipeline to generate synthetic graphs and propose a two-stage training scheme. Experimental results show that our plan-over-graph method significantly improves task performance on both API-based LLMs and trainable open-sourced LLMs. By normalizing complex tasks as graphs, our method naturally supports parallel execution, demonstrating global efficiency. The code and data are available at https://github.com/zsq259/Plan-over-Graph.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

An Experimental Analysis of In-context Learning and Fine-tuning on Open LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14561v1)**<details>This work investigates the ability of open Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict citation intent through in-context learning and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on pre-trained models like SciBERT, which require extensive domain-specific pretraining and specialized architectures, we demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs can be adapted to this task with minimal task-specific data. We evaluate twelve model variations across five prominent open LLM families using zero, one, few, and many-shot prompting to assess performance across scenarios. Our experimental study identifies the top-performing model through extensive experimentation of in-context learning-related parameters, which we fine-tune to further enhance task performance. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in recognizing citation intents, providing valuable insights for model selection and prompt engineering. Additionally, we make our end-to-end evaluation framework and models openly available for future use.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

Despite their potential, most existing works rely solely on users' purchase histories, leaving significant room for improvement by incorporating user-generated textual data, such as reviews and product descriptions. Addressing this gap, we propose PURE, a novel LLM-based recommendation framework that builds and maintains evolving user profiles by systematically extracting and summarizing key information from user reviews. PURE consists of three core components: a Review Extractor for identifying user preferences and key product features, a Profile Updater for refining and updating user profiles, and a Recommender for generating personalized recommendations using the most current profile. To evaluate PURE, we introduce a continuous sequential recommendation task that reflects real-world scenarios by adding reviews over time and updating predictions incrementally. Our experimental results on Amazon datasets demonstrate that PURE outperforms existing LLM-based methods, effectively leveraging long-term user information while managing token limitations.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Submitted to ACL 2025</details> |

An Information-Theoretic Analysis of L1-Dependent Biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14507v1)**<details>This study evaluates Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to simulate non-native-like English use observed in human second language (L2) learners interfered with by their native first language (L1). In dialogue-based interviews, we prompt LLMs to mimic L2 English learners with specific L1s (e.g., Japanese, Thai, Urdu) across seven languages, comparing their outputs to real L2 learner data. Our analysis examines L1-driven linguistic biases, such as reference word usage and avoidance behaviors, using information-theoretic and distributional density measures. Results show that modern LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLAMA3.3, DeepseekV3, GPT-4o) replicate L1-dependent patterns observed in human L2 data, with distinct influences from various languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin significantly affect tense agreement, and Urdu influences noun-verb collocations). Our results reveal the potential of LLMs for L2 dialogue generation and evaluation for future educational applications.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular and efficient training technique for updating or domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. In this study, we investigate how new facts can be incorporated into the LLM using LoRA without compromising the previously learned knowledge. We fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-instruct using LoRA with varying amounts of new knowledge. Our experiments have shown that the best results are obtained when the training data contains a mixture of known and new facts. However, this approach is still potentially harmful because the model's performance on external question-answering benchmarks declines after such fine-tuning. When the training data is biased towards certain entities, the model tends to regress to few overrepresented answers. In addition, we found that the model becomes more confident and refuses to provide an answer in only few cases. These findings highlight the potential pitfalls of LoRA-based LLM updates and underscore the importance of training data composition and tuning parameters to balance new knowledge integration and general model capabilities.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[LLM4FaaS: No-Code Application Development using LLMs and FaaS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14450v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that can generate code from natural language descriptions. While this theoretically enables non-technical users to develop their own applications, they typically lack the expertise to execute, deploy, and operate generated code. This poses a barrier for such users to leverage the power of LLMs for application development. In this paper, we propose leveraging the high levels of abstraction of the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm to handle code execution and operation for non-technical users. FaaS offers function deployment without handling the underlying infrastructure, enabling users to execute LLM-generated code without concern for its operation and without requiring any technical expertise. We propose LLM4FaaS, a novel no-code application development approach that combines LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run their own applications using only natural language descriptions. Specifically, LLM4FaaS takes user prompts, uses LLMs to generate function code based on those prompts, and deploys these functions through a FaaS platform that handles the application's operation. LLM4FaaS also leverages the FaaS infrastructure abstractions to reduce the task complexity for the LLM, improving result accuracy. We evaluate LLM4FaaS with a proof-of-concept implementation based on GPT-4o and an open-source FaaS platform, using real prompts from non-technical users. Our evaluation based on these real user prompts demonstrates the feasibility of our approach and shows that LLM4FaaS can reliably build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, up from 43.48% in a baseline without FaaS.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[PredictaBoard: Benchmarking LLM Score Predictability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14445v1)**<details>Despite possessing impressive skills, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail unpredictably, demonstrating inconsistent success in even basic common sense reasoning tasks. This unpredictability poses a significant challenge to ensuring their safe deployment, as identifying and operating within a reliable "safe zone" is essential for mitigating risks. To address this, we present PredictaBoard, a novel collaborative benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the ability of score predictors (referred to as assessors) to anticipate LLM errors on specific task instances (i.e., prompts) from existing datasets. PredictaBoard evaluates pairs of LLMs and assessors by considering the rejection rate at different tolerance errors. As such, PredictaBoard stimulates research into developing better assessors and making LLMs more predictable, not only with a higher average performance. We conduct illustrative experiments using baseline assessors and state-of-the-art LLMs. PredictaBoard highlights the critical need to evaluate predictability alongside performance, paving the way for safer AI systems where errors are not only minimised but also anticipated and effectively mitigated. Code for our benchmark can be found at https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/PredictaBoar</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

On Multilingual Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12769v2)**<details>In the age of misinformation, hallucination -- the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate non-factual or unfaithful responses -- represents the main risk for their global utility. Despite LLMs becoming increasingly multilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM hallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT) and summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open information seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM hallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question answering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model and conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM families. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on MT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually annotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for these languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between silver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data for estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates estimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with LLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while LLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for higher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized hallucination rates of languages and their digital representation. Further, we find that smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination rates than larger models.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

While current methods often use encoder or encoder-decoder deep learning architectures, decoder-only models remain largely unexplored, offering a promising research direction. This paper proposes leveraging open-source, small Large Language Models (LLMs) for argument mining through few-shot prompting and fine-tuning. These models' small size and open-source nature ensure accessibility, privacy, and computational efficiency, enabling schools and educators to adopt and deploy them locally. Specifically, we perform three tasks: segmentation of student essays into arguments, classification of the arguments by type, and assessment of their quality. We empirically evaluate the models on the Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments dataset of grade 6-12 students essays and demonstrate how fine-tuned small LLMs outperform baseline methods in segmenting the essays and determining the argument types while few-shot prompting yields comparable performance to that of the baselines in assessing quality. This work highlights the educational potential of small, open-source LLMs to provide real-time, personalized feedback, enhancing independent learning and writing skills while ensuring low computational cost and privacy.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

This paper presents SolSearch, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to discover and optimize SAT-solving strategies automatically. Leveraging a curriculum-based, trial-and-error process, SolSearch enables the LLM to iteratively modify and generate SAT solver code, thereby improving solving efficiency and performance. This automated SAT-solving paradigm has the advantage of being plug-and-play, allowing integration with any SAT solver and accelerating the development or design process of new SAT solvers (new methods). Our preliminary experimental results are encouraging by demonstrating that the LLM-powered paradigm improves state-of-the-art SAT solvers on general SAT benchmarks and significantly enhances the performance of the widely used Z3 solver (11\% on PAR-2 score). These results highlight the potential for using LLM-driven methods to advance solver adaptability and effectiveness in real-world software engineering challenges. Future research directions are discussed to further refine and validate this approach, offering a promising avenue for integrating AI with traditional software engineering tasks.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

Building upon these strengths, researchers have begun incorporating LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents collaborate or compete through natural language interactions to tackle tasks beyond the scope of single-agent setups. In this survey, we present a communication-centric perspective on LLM-based multi-agent systems, examining key system-level features such as architecture design and communication goals, as well as internal mechanisms like communication strategies, paradigms, objects and content.

| **[Efficient AI in Practice: Training and Deployment of Efficient LLMs for Industry Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14305v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of industrial applications, from search and recommendations to generative tasks. Although scaling laws indicate that larger models generally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial computational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world scenarios at scale. In this paper, we present methods and insights for training small language models (SLMs) that deliver high performance and efficiency in deployment. We focus on two key techniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via quantization and pruning. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the quality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing training, serving costs, and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on a variety of use cases at a large professional social network platform and share deployment lessons - including hardware optimization strategies that enhance speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based applications.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Towards Geo-Culturally Grounded LLM Generations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13497v2)**<details>Generative large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to have gaps in diverse, cultural knowledge across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on the ability of LLMs to display familiarity with a diverse range of national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on a series of cultural familiarity benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., the norms, artifacts, and institutions of national cultures), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models, while failing to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional knowledge about a culture and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating the cultural familiarity of generative LLMs.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[SWE-Fixer: Training Open-Source LLMs for Effective and Efficient GitHub Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05040v2)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a variety of complex tasks. One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other model to generate patches for the identified files. To mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches and train the two models of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with scores of 24.7% and 32.8%, respectively. Additionally, our approach requires only two model calls per instance, making it significantly more efficient than existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of SWE-Fixer in real-world code-fixing scenarios. We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Our code, data, and model will be released at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer</details> |
| **[SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406v4)**<details>Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpinQuant.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>ICLR 2025</details> |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, but their application to event-based visual recognition remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LLM-EvGen}, an event representation generator that produces LLM-compatible event representations \textbf{LLM-EvRep}, thereby enhancing the performance of LLMs on event recognition tasks. The generator is trained using a self-supervised framework, aligning the generated representations with semantic consistency and structural fidelity. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three datasets: N-ImageNet, N-Caltech101, and N-MNIST. The results demonstrate that our method, \textbf{LLM-EvRep}, outperforms the event-to-video method, E2VID, by 15.93\%, 0.82\%, and 50.21\%, respectively, in recognition tasks when evaluated using GPT-4o.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>6 pages, 2 figures,Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW Companion '25)</details> |

Utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, PaperHelper effectively minimizes hallucinations commonly encountered in large language models (LLMs), optimizing the extraction of accurate, high-quality knowledge. The implementation of advanced technologies such as RAFT and RAG Fusion significantly boosts the performance, accuracy, and reliability of the LLMs-based literature review process. Additionally, PaperHelper features a user-friendly interface that facilitates the batch downloading of documents and uses the Mermaid format to illustrate structural relationships between documents. Experimental results demonstrate that PaperHelper, based on a fine-tuned GPT-4 API, achieves an F1 Score of 60.04, with a latency of only 5.8 seconds, outperforming the basic RAG model by 7\% in F1 Score.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[SCOOT: SLO-Oriented Performance Tuning for LLM Inference Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04323v2)**<details>As large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity across a wide range of web applications, it is of great importance to optimize service-level objectives (SLOs) for LLM inference services to enhance user satisfaction and improve the competitiveness of cloud vendors. In this paper, we observe that adjusting the parameters of LLM inference engines can improve service performance, and the optimal parameter configurations of different services are different. Therefore, we propose SCOOT, an automatic performance tuning system to optimize SLOs for each LLM inference service by tuning the parameters of the inference engine. SCOOT jointly exploits single-objective and multiple-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) techniques to handle various optimization objectives via exploration and exploitation. Moreover, SCOOT prunes the search space with known constraints and adopts a random forest to learn hidden constraints during the tuning process to mitigate invalid exploration. To improve the tuning efficiency, SCOOT utilizes the parallel suggestion to accelerate the tuning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCOOT considerably outperforms existing tuning techniques in SLO optimization while greatly improving the tuning efficiency. Moreover, SCOOT is universally applicable to various LLM inference engines including vLLM and TensorRT-LLM. Currently, SCOOT has already been implemented in the production environment at Ant Group.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Accepted by The ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW'25)</details> |
| **[Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14251v2)**<details>Post-training is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. However, its effectiveness depends on high-quality instruction data, which is challenging to obtain in the real world due to privacy concerns, data scarcity, and high annotation costs. To fill this gap, inspired by the recent success of using LLMs to simulate human society, we propose MATRIX, a multi-agent simulator that automatically generates diverse text-based scenarios, capturing a wide range of real-world human needs in a realistic and scalable manner. Leveraging these outputs, we introduce a novel scenario-driven instruction generator MATRIX-Gen for controllable and highly realistic data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively generates both general and domain-specific data. On AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, Llama-3-8B-Base, post-trained on datasets synthesized by MATRIX-Gen with just 20K instruction-response pairs, outperforms Meta's Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, which was trained on over 10M pairs.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Investigating the Impact of LLM Personality on Cognitive Bias Manifestation in Automated Decision-Making Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14219v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making, yet their susceptibility to cognitive biases remains a pressing challenge. This study explores how personality traits influence these biases and evaluates the effectiveness of mitigation strategies across various model architectures. Our findings identify six prevalent cognitive biases, while the sunk cost and group attribution biases exhibit minimal impact. Personality traits play a crucial role in either amplifying or reducing biases, significantly affecting how LLMs respond to debiasing techniques. Notably, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness may generally enhance the efficacy of bias mitigation strategies, suggesting that LLMs exhibiting these traits are more receptive to corrective measures. These findings address the importance of personality-driven bias dynamics and highlight the need for targeted mitigation approaches to improve fairness and reliability in AI-assisted decision-making.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Towards Secure Program Partitioning for Smart Contracts with LLM's In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14215v1)**<details>Smart contracts are highly susceptible to manipulation attacks due to the leakage of sensitive information. Addressing manipulation vulnerabilities is particularly challenging because they stem from inherent data confidentiality issues rather than straightforward implementation bugs. To tackle this by preventing sensitive information leakage, we present PartitionGPT, the first LLM-driven approach that combines static analysis with the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to partition smart contracts into privileged and normal codebases, guided by a few annotated sensitive data variables. We evaluated PartitionGPT on 18 annotated smart contracts containing 99 sensitive functions. The results demonstrate that PartitionGPT successfully generates compilable, and verified partitions for 78% of the sensitive functions while reducing approximately 30% code compared to function-level partitioning approach. Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine real-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million dollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its potential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program partitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation vulnerabilities.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Think Together and Work Better: Combining Humans' and LLMs' Think-Aloud Outcomes for Effective Text Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07355v2)**<details>This study introduces \textbf{InteractEval}, a framework that integrates human expertise and Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Think-Aloud (TA) method to generate attributes for checklist-based text evaluation. By combining human flexibility and reasoning with LLM consistency, InteractEval outperforms traditional non-LLM-based and LLM-based baselines across four distinct dimensions, consisting of Coherence, Fluency, Consistency, and Relevance. The experiment also investigates the effectiveness of the TA method, showing that it promotes divergent thinking in both humans and LLMs, leading to the generation of a wider range of relevant attributes and enhance text evaluation performance. Comparative analysis reveals that humans excel at identifying attributes related to internal quality (Coherence and Fluency), but LLMs perform better at those attributes related to external alignment (Consistency and Relevance). Consequently, leveraging both humans and LLMs together produces the best evaluation outcomes. In other words, this study emphasizes the necessity of effectively combining humans and LLMs in an automated checklist-based text evaluation framework.

| **[Do LLMs Consider Security? An Empirical Study on Responses to Programming Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14202v1)**<details>The widespread adoption of conversational LLMs for software development has raised new security concerns regarding the safety of LLM-generated content. Our motivational study outlines ChatGPT's potential in volunteering context-specific information to the developers, promoting safe coding practices. Motivated by this finding, we conduct a study to evaluate the degree of security awareness exhibited by three prominent LLMs: Claude 3, GPT-4, and Llama 3. We prompt these LLMs with Stack Overflow questions that contain vulnerable code to evaluate whether they merely provide answers to the questions or if they also warn users about the insecure code, thereby demonstrating a degree of security awareness. Further, we assess whether LLM responses provide information about the causes, exploits, and the potential fixes of the vulnerability, to help raise users' awareness. Our findings show that all three models struggle to accurately detect and warn users about vulnerabilities, achieving a detection rate of only 12.6% to 40% across our datasets. We also observe that the LLMs tend to identify certain types of vulnerabilities related to sensitive information exposure and improper input neutralization much more frequently than other types, such as those involving external control of file names or paths. Furthermore, when LLMs do issue security warnings, they often provide more information on the causes, exploits, and fixes of vulnerabilities compared to Stack Overflow responses. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion on the implications of our findings and present a CLI-based prompting tool that can be used to generate significantly more secure LLM responses.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[NLP-AKG: Few-Shot Construction of NLP Academic Knowledge Graph Based on LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14192v1)**<details>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied in question answering over scientific research papers. To enhance the professionalism and accuracy of responses, many studies employ external knowledge augmentation. However, existing structures of external knowledge in scientific literature often focus solely on either paper entities or domain concepts, neglecting the intrinsic connections between papers through shared domain concepts. This results in less comprehensive and specific answers when addressing questions that combine papers and concepts. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge graph framework that captures deep conceptual relations between academic papers, constructing a relational network via intra-paper semantic elements and inter-paper citation relations. Using a few-shot knowledge graph construction method based on LLM, we develop NLP-AKG, an academic knowledge graph for the NLP domain, by extracting 620,353 entities and 2,271,584 relations from 60,826 papers in ACL Anthology. Based on this, we propose a 'sub-graph community summary' method and validate its effectiveness on three NLP scientific literature question answering datasets.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

While prior research on data poisoning attacks has primarily focused on the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs, these attacks face significant challenges in practice. Secure data collection, rigorous data cleaning, and the multistage nature of LLM training make it difficult to inject poisoned data or reliably influence LLM behavior as intended. Given these challenges, this position paper proposes rethinking the role of data poisoning and argue that multi-faceted studies on data poisoning can advance LLM development. From a threat perspective, practical strategies for data poisoning attacks can help evaluate and address real safety risks to LLMs. From a trustworthiness perspective, data poisoning can be leveraged to build more robust LLMs by uncovering and mitigating hidden biases, harmful outputs, and hallucinations. Moreover, from a mechanism perspective, data poisoning can provide valuable insights into LLMs, particularly the interplay between data and model behavior, driving a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Learning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10490v3)**<details>Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique "squeezing effect" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

In this work, we develop a multi-task unlearning benchmark (LUME) which features three tasks: (1) unlearn synthetically generated creative short novels, (2) unlearn synthetic biographies with sensitive information, and (3) unlearn a collection of public biographies. We further release two fine-tuned LLMs of 1B and 7B parameter sizes as the target models.

Using fuzzy graph, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and community detection, we analyze embeddings from diverse LLMs, finding significant categorical community structure aligned with predefined concepts and categories aligned with humans. We observe these groupings exhibit within-cluster organization (such as hierarchies, topological ordering, etc.), hypothesizing a fundamental structure that precedes contextual processing. To further investigate the conceptual nature of these groupings, we explore cross-model alignments across different LLM categories within their input embeddings, observing a medium to high degree of alignment. Furthermore, provide evidence that manipulating these groupings can play a functional role in mitigating ethnicity bias in LLM tasks.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

This raises the question of how well the LLM's learned representations align with human representations. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to the study of representation alignment: we adopt a method from research on activation steering to identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., 'cat') and then analyze the corresponding activation patterns. Our findings reveal that LLM representations closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data. Notably, this alignment surpasses that of word embeddings, which have been center stage in prior work on human and model alignment. Additionally, our approach enables a more granular view of how LLMs represent concepts. Specifically, we show that LLMs organize concepts in a way that reflects hierarchical relationships interpretable to humans (e.g., 'animal'-'dog').</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[Can LLMs Improve Multimodal Fact-Checking by Asking Relevant Questions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04616v2)**<details>Traditional fact-checking relies on humans to formulate relevant and targeted fact-checking questions (FCQs), search for evidence, and verify the factuality of claims. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been commonly used to automate evidence retrieval and factuality verification at scale, their effectiveness for fact-checking is hindered by the absence of FCQ formulation. To bridge this gap, we seek to answer two research questions: (1) Can LLMs generate relevant FCQs? (2) Can LLM-generated FCQs improve multimodal fact-checking? We therefore introduce a framework LRQ-FACT for using LLMs to generate relevant FCQs to facilitate evidence retrieval and enhance fact-checking by probing information across multiple modalities. Through extensive experiments, we verify if LRQ-FACT can generate relevant FCQs of different types and if LRQ-FACT can consistently outperform baseline methods in multimodal fact-checking. Further analysis illustrates how each component in LRQ-FACT works toward improving the fact-checking performance.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |

However, we are facing significant challenges when deploying LLMs into RecSys, such as limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and un-constrained generation of recommendations, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method using a taxonomy dictionary. This method provides a systematic framework for categorizing and organizing items, improving the clarity and structure of item information. By incorporating the taxonomy dictionary into LLM prompts, we achieve efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. Our Taxonomy-guided Recommendation (TaxRec) approach features a two-step process: one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation, enabling zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches, showcasing its efficacy as personal recommender with LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/yueqingliang1/TaxRec.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

This paper addresses the gap by focusing on the application of LLMs to the United Nations (UN) decision-making process, where the stakes are particularly high and political decisions can have far-reaching consequences. We introduce a novel dataset comprising publicly available UN Security Council (UNSC) records from 1994 to 2024, including draft resolutions, voting records, and diplomatic speeches. Using this dataset, we propose the United Nations Benchmark (UNBench), the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across four interconnected political science tasks: co-penholder judgment, representative voting simulation, draft adoption prediction, and representative statement generation. These tasks span the three stages of the UN decision-making process--drafting, voting, and discussing--and aim to assess LLMs' ability to understand and simulate political dynamics. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the potential and challenges of applying LLMs in this domain, providing insights into their strengths and limitations in political science. This work contributes to the growing intersection of AI and political science, opening new avenues for research and practical applications in global governance.

Here, we examine the issue of reasoning from the perspective of claim verification. We propose a framework designed to break down any claim paired with evidence into atomic reasoning types that are necessary for verification. We use this framework to create Reasoning in Evidence-based Claim Verification (RECV), the first claim verification benchmark, incorporating real-world claims, to assess the deductive and abductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises of three datasets, covering reasoning problems of increasing complexity. We evaluate three state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs under multiple prompt settings. Our results show that while LLMs can address deductive reasoning problems, they consistently fail in cases of abductive reasoning. Moreover, we observe that enhancing LLMs with rationale generation is not always beneficial. Nonetheless, we find that generated rationales are semantically similar to those provided by humans, especially in deductive reasoning cases.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>{\dag} These authors contributed equally to this work. 23 pages, 3 figur</details> |
| **[Towards Context-Robust LLMs: A Gated Representation Fine-tuning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14100v1)**<details>Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

The most common method in this paradigm, pairwise comparisons with a baseline model, critically depends on the assumption of transitive preferences. However, the validity of this assumption remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the presence of non-transitivity within the AlpacaEval framework and analyze its effects on model rankings. We find that LLM judges exhibit non-transitive preferences, leading to rankings that are sensitive to the choice of the baseline model. To mitigate this issue, we show that round-robin tournaments combined with Bradley-Terry models of preference can produce more reliable rankings. Notably, our method increases both the Spearman correlation and the Kendall correlation with Chatbot Arena (95.0% -> 96.4% and 82.1% -> 86.3% respectively). To address the computational cost of round-robin tournaments, we propose Swiss-Wise Iterative Matchmaking (Swim) tournaments, using a dynamic matching strategy to capture the benefits of round-robin tournaments while maintaining computational efficiency.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables (30 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables including references and appendices)</details> |

The diversity of these rationales is mediated by the ability to consider the perspectives of different social actors. However, it remains unclear whether and how models differ in the distribution of perspectives they provide. We compare the perspectives taken by humans and different LLMs when assessing subtle sexism scenarios. We show that these perspectives can be classified within a finite set (perpetrator, victim, decision-maker), consistently present in argumentations produced by humans and LLMs, but in different distributions and combinations, demonstrating differences and similarities with human responses, and between models. We argue for the need to systematically evaluate LLMs' perspective-taking to identify the most suitable models for a given decision-making task. We discuss the implications for model evaluation.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>Accepted at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</details> |
| **[MaskPrune: Mask-based LLM Pruning for Layer-wise Uniform Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14008v1)**<details>The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in various language tasks has attracted considerable attention. However, the ever-increasing size of these models presents growing challenges for deployment and inference. Structured pruning, an effective model compression technique, is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to enhance inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most previous optimization-based structured pruning methods sacrifice the uniform structure across layers for greater flexibility to maintain performance. The heterogeneous structure hinders the effective utilization of off-the-shelf inference acceleration techniques and impedes efficient configuration for continued training. To address this issue, we propose a novel masking learning paradigm based on minimax optimization to obtain the uniform pruned structure by optimizing the masks under sparsity regularization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can maintain high performance while ensuring the uniformity of the pruned model structure, thereby outperforming existing SOTA methods.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[Beyond Single-Value Metrics: Evaluating and Enhancing LLM Unlearning with Cognitive Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13996v1)**<details>Due to the widespread use of LLMs and the rising critical ethical and safety concerns, LLM unlearning methods have been developed to remove harmful knowledge and undesirable capabilities. In this context, evaluations are mostly based on single-value metrics such as QA accuracy. However, these metrics often fail to capture the nuanced retention of harmful knowledge components, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of unlearning. To address this issue, we propose UNCD (UNlearning evaluation via Cognitive Diagnosis), a novel framework that leverages Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling for fine-grained evaluation of LLM unlearning. Our dedicated benchmark, UNCD-Cyber, provides a detailed assessment of the removal of dangerous capabilities. Moreover, we introduce UNCD-Agent, which refines unlearning by diagnosing knowledge remnants and generating targeted unlearning data. Extensive experiments across eight unlearning methods and two base models demonstrate that UNCD not only enhances evaluation but also effectively facilitates the removal of harmful LLM abilities.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890v4)**<details>Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[How Do LLMs Perform Two-Hop Reasoning in Context?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13913v1)**<details>"Socrates is human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." This classical example demonstrates two-hop reasoning, where a conclusion logically follows from two connected premises. While transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) can make two-hop reasoning, they tend to collapse to random guessing when faced with distracting premises. To understand the underlying mechanism, we train a three-layer transformer on synthetic two-hop reasoning tasks. The training dynamics show two stages: a slow learning phase, where the 3-layer transformer performs random guessing like LLMs, followed by an abrupt phase transitions, where the 3-layer transformer suddenly reaches $100%$ accuracy. Through reverse engineering, we explain the inner mechanisms for how models learn to randomly guess between distractions initially, and how they learn to ignore distractions eventually. We further propose a three-parameter model that supports the causal claims for the mechanisms to the training dynamics of the transformer. Finally, experiments on LLMs suggest that the discovered mechanisms generalize across scales. Our methodologies provide new perspectives for scientific understandings of LLMs and our findings provide new insights into how reasoning emerges during training.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[Judging the Judges: A Collection of LLM-Generated Relevance Judgements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13908v1)**<details>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for relevance assessments offers promising opportunities to improve Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and related fields. Indeed, LLMs hold the promise of allowing IR experimenters to build evaluation collections with a fraction of the manual human labor currently required. This could help with fresh topics on which there is still limited knowledge and could mitigate the challenges of evaluating ranking systems in low-resource scenarios, where it is challenging to find human annotators. Given the fast-paced recent developments in the domain, many questions concerning LLMs as assessors are yet to be answered. Among the aspects that require further investigation, we can list the impact of various components in a relevance judgment generation pipeline, such as the prompt used or the LLM chosen. This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where different relevance assessment approaches were proposed. In detail, we release and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in the challenge. Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models, analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques.

| **[DataSciBench: An LLM Agent Benchmark for Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13897v1)**<details>This paper presents DataSciBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities in data science. Recent related benchmarks have primarily focused on single tasks, easily obtainable ground truth, and straightforward evaluation metrics, which limits the scope of tasks that can be evaluated. In contrast, DataSciBench is constructed based on a more comprehensive and curated collection of natural and challenging prompts for uncertain ground truth and evaluation metrics. We develop a semi-automated pipeline for generating ground truth (GT) and validating evaluation metrics. This pipeline utilizes and implements an LLM-based self-consistency and human verification strategy to produce accurate GT by leveraging collected prompts, predefined task types, and aggregate functions (metrics). Furthermore, we propose an innovative Task - Function - Code (TFC) framework to assess each code execution outcome based on precisely defined metrics and programmatic rules. Our experimental framework involves testing 6 API-based models, 8 open-source general models, and 9 open-source code generation models using the diverse set of prompts we have gathered. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of LLMs in data science, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. Experimental results demonstrate that API-based models outperform open-sourced models on all metrics and Deepseek-Coder-33B-Instruct achieves the highest score among open-sourced models.

Popular post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP provide marginal feature attributions, while their extensions to interaction importances only scale to small input lengths ($\approx 20$). We propose Spectral Explainer (SPEX), a model-agnostic interaction attribution algorithm that efficiently scales to large input lengths ($\approx 1000)$. SPEX exploits underlying natural sparsity among interactions -- common in real-world data -- and applies a sparse Fourier transform using a channel decoding algorithm to efficiently identify important interactions. We perform experiments across three difficult long-context datasets that require LLMs to utilize interactions between inputs to complete the task. For large inputs, SPEX outperforms marginal attribution methods by up to 20% in terms of faithfully reconstructing LLM outputs. Further, SPEX successfully identifies key features and interactions that strongly influence model output. For one of our datasets, HotpotQA, SPEX provides interactions that align with human annotations. Finally, we use our model-agnostic approach to generate explanations to demonstrate abstract reasoning in closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o mini) and compositional reasoning in vision-language models.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce CoT-Rec, a framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-driven recommendations by incorporating two crucial processes: user preference analysis and item perception evaluation. CoT-Rec operates in two key phases: (1) personalized data extraction, where user preferences and item perceptions are identified, and (2) personalized data application, where this information is leveraged to refine recommendations. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that CoT-Rec improves recommendation accuracy by making better use of LLMs' reasoning potential.

However, existing methods struggle with cross-domain scenarios due to inefficient memory structures, leading to irrelevant information retention and failure to account for social influence factors such as popularity. To address these limitations, we introduce AgentCF++, a novel framework featuring a dual-layer memory architecture and a two-step fusion mechanism to filter domain-specific preferences effectively. Additionally, we propose interest groups with shared memory, allowing the model to capture the impact of popularity trends on users with similar interests. Through extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets, AgentCF++ demonstrates superior performance over baseline models, highlighting its effectiveness in refining user behavior simulation for recommender systems.

However, the space of possible tactics is vast and complex, while the available training data for formal proofs is limited, posing a significant challenge to LLM-based tactic generation. To address this, we introduce a neuro-symbolic tactic generator that synergizes the mathematical intuition learned by LLMs with domain-specific insights encoded by symbolic methods. The key aspect of this integration is identifying which parts of mathematical reasoning are best suited to LLMs and which to symbolic methods. While the high-level idea of neuro-symbolic integration is broadly applicable to various mathematical problems, in this paper, we focus specifically on Olympiad inequalities (Figure~1). We analyze how humans solve these problems and distill the techniques into two types of tactics: (1) scaling, handled by symbolic methods, and (2) rewriting, handled by LLMs. In addition, we combine symbolic tools with LLMs to prune and rank the proof goals for efficient proof search. We evaluate our framework on 161 challenging inequalities from multiple mathematics competitions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforming existing LLM and symbolic approaches without requiring additional training data.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

Model scaling-up offers a promising solution by leveraging the parameters of smaller models to create larger ones. However, existing depth scaling-up methods rely on empirical heuristic rules for layer duplication, which result in poorer initialization and slower convergence during continual pre-training. We propose \textbf{LESA}, a novel learnable method for depth scaling-up. By concatenating parameters from each layer and applying Singular Value Decomposition, we uncover latent patterns between layers, suggesting that inter-layer parameters can be learned. LESA uses a neural network to predict the parameters inserted between adjacent layers, enabling better initialization and faster training. Experiments show that LESA outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior performance with less than half the computational cost during continual pre-training. Extensive analyses demonstrate its effectiveness across different model sizes and tasks.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

However, are they also able to effectively collaborate over long-term interactions? To investigate this, we introduce MemoryCode, a synthetic multi-session dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to track and execute simple coding instructions amid irrelevant information, simulating a realistic setting. While all the models we tested handle isolated instructions well, even the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o deteriorates when instructions are spread across sessions. Our analysis suggests this is due to their failure to retrieve and integrate information over long instruction chains. Our results highlight a fundamental limitation of current LLMs, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively in long interactions.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

Recent advancements in feature interaction and user behavior modeling have significantly enhanced the recall and ranking processes of these systems. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to further improve recommendation systems. This tutorial explores two primary approaches for integrating LLMs: LLMs-enhanced recommendations, which leverage the reasoning capabilities of general LLMs, and generative large recommendation models, which focus on scaling and sophistication. While the former has been extensively covered in existing literature, the latter remains underexplored. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of generative large recommendation models, including their recent advancements, challenges, and potential research directions. Key topics include data quality, scaling laws, user behavior mining, and efficiency in training and inference. By engaging with this tutorial, participants will gain insights into the latest developments and future opportunities in the field, aiding both academic research and practical applications. The timely nature of this exploration supports the rapid evolution of recommendation systems, offering valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners alike.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>This paper has been accepted for the tutorial track at WWW 2025</details> |

Automatically Measuring Information Potential in Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13691v1)**<details>As large language models (LLMs) converge towards similar capabilities, the key to advancing their performance lies in identifying and incorporating valuable new information sources. However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using three strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts (likely containing novel specialized knowledge), Wikipedia articles (presumably part of training data), and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the potential to accomplish software engineering tasks, existing methods for environment configuration often rely on manual efforts or fragile scripts, leading to inefficiencies and unreliable outcomes. We introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent designed to fully automate environment configuration and generate executable Dockerfiles for arbitrary Python repositories. We address two major challenges: (1) enabling the LLM agent to configure environments within isolated Docker containers, and (2) ensuring the successful configuration process is recorded and accurately transferred to a Dockerfile without error. To achieve this, we propose atomic configuration synthesis, featuring a dual-environment architecture (internal and external environment) with a rollback mechanism to prevent environment "pollution" from failed commands, guaranteeing atomic execution (execute fully or not at all) and a Dockerfile generator to transfer successful configuration steps into runnable Dockerfiles. We evaluate Repo2Run~on our proposed benchmark of 420 recent Python repositories with unit tests, where it achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming the best baseline by 63.9%.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

Beyond leveraging external knowledge to improve response accuracy, they require key capabilities for reliable knowledge-handling: resolving conflicts between knowledge sources, avoiding distraction from uninformative external knowledge, and abstaining when sufficient knowledge is unavailable. Prior studies have examined these scenarios in isolation or with limited scope. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing knowledge-handling based on two key dimensions: the presence of parametric knowledge and the informativeness of external knowledge. Through analysis, we identify biases in knowledge utilization and examine how the ability to handle one scenario impacts performance in others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training on data constructed based on the knowledge-handling scenarios improves LLMs' reliability in integrating and utilizing knowledge.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>under-review</details> |

While significant progress has been made in developing taxonomies for LLM risks and safety evaluation prompts, most studies have focused on monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, language- and region-specific risks in bilingual contexts are often overlooked, and core findings can diverge from those in monolingual settings. In this paper, we introduce Qorgau, a novel dataset specifically designed for safety evaluation in Kazakh and Russian, reflecting the unique bilingual context in Kazakhstan, where both Kazakh (a low-resource language) and Russian (a high-resource language) are spoken. Experiments with both multilingual and language-specific LLMs reveal notable differences in safety performance, emphasizing the need for tailored, region-specific datasets to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in countries like Kazakhstan.

More recent in-hoc approaches, such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), offer both interpretability and intervenability by incorporating explicit concept representations. However, these methods suffer from key limitations, including reliance on labeled concept datasets and significant architectural modifications that challenges re-integration into existing system pipelines. In this work, we introduce a new methodology for incorporating interpretability and intervenability into an existing model by integrating Concept Layers (CLs) into its architecture. Our approach projects the model's internal vector representations into a conceptual, explainable vector space before reconstructing and feeding them back into the model. Furthermore, we eliminate the need for a human-selected concept set by algorithmically searching an ontology for a set of concepts that can be either task-specific or task-agnostic. We evaluate CLs across multiple tasks, demonstrating that they maintain the original model's performance and agreement while enabling meaningful interventions. Additionally, we present a proof of concept showcasing an intervenability interface, allowing users to adjust model behavior dynamically, such as mitigating biases during inference.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[The Impact of Inference Acceleration on Bias of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22118v2)**<details>Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

Recent encoding models using deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully predicted voxel-wise activity. However, interpreting the properties that explain voxel responses remains challenging because of the black-box nature of DNNs. As a solution, we propose LLM-assisted Visual Cortex Captioning (LaVCa), a data-driven approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate natural-language captions for images to which voxels are selective. By applying LaVCa for image-evoked brain activity, we demonstrate that LaVCa generates captions that describe voxel selectivity more accurately than the previously proposed method. Furthermore, the captions generated by LaVCa quantitatively capture more detailed properties than the existing method at both the inter-voxel and intra-voxel levels. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the voxel-specific properties generated by LaVCa reveals fine-grained functional differentiation within regions of interest (ROIs) in the visual cortex and voxels that simultaneously represent multiple distinct concepts. These findings offer profound insights into human visual representations by assigning detailed captions throughout the visual cortex while highlighting the potential of LLM-based methods in understanding brain representations.

| **[Efficient Safety Retrofitting Against Jailbreaking for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13603v1)**<details>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alignment technique that steers LLMs towards preferable outputs by training on preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward models. Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |

In this work, we conjecture that in the latent space of these large language models, the embeddings live in a local manifold structure with different dimensions depending on the perplexities and domains of the input data, commonly referred to as a Stratified Manifold structure, which in combination form a structured space known as a Stratified Space. To investigate the validity of this structural claim, we propose an analysis framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model where each expert is implemented with a simple dictionary learning algorithm at varying sparsity levels. By incorporating an attention-based soft-gating network, we verify that our model learns specialized sub-manifolds for an ensemble of input data sources, reflecting the semantic stratification in LLM embedding space. We further analyze the intrinsic dimensions of these stratified sub-manifolds and present extensive statistics on expert assignments, gating entropy, and inter-expert distances. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method not only validates the claim of a stratified manifold structure in the LLM embedding space, but also provides interpretable clusters that align with the intrinsic semantic variations of the input data.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
