| **[CDGS: Confidence-Aware Depth Regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14684v1)**<details>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown significant advantages in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly in achieving high rendering speeds and high-quality results. However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[CaRtGS: Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00486v3)**<details>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is pivotal in robotics, with photorealistic scene reconstruction emerging as a key challenge. To address this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that enhances optimization iterations, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica, TUM-RGBD, and VECtor datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing photorealistic scene representation. For the benefit of the research community, we release the code and accompanying videos on our project website: https://dapengfeng.github.io/cartgs.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</details> |
| **[Hier-SLAM: Scaling-up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12518v3)**<details>We propose Hier-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hier-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2025.

| **[OG-Gaussian: Occupancy Based Street Gaussians for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14235v1)**<details>Accurate and realistic 3D scene reconstruction enables the lifelike creation of autonomous driving simulation environments. With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.</details> | 2025-02-20 |  |
| **[3D-Adapter: Geometry-Consistent Multi-View Diffusion for High-Quality 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18974v2)**<details>Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>Project page: https://lakonik.github.io/3d-adapter/</details> |
| **[OccGaussian: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Occluded Human Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08449v3)**<details>Rendering dynamic 3D human from monocular videos is crucial for various applications such as virtual reality and digital entertainment. Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area. Extensive experiments both in simulated and real-world occlusions, demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. And we improving training and inference speeds by 250x and 800x, respectively. Our code will be available for research purposes.</details> | 2025-02-20 | <details>We have decided to withdraw this paper because the results require further verification or additional experimental data.

| **[3D Gaussian Splatting aided Localization for Large and Complex Indoor-Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13803v1)**<details>The field of visual localization has been researched for several decades and has meanwhile found many practical applications. Despite the strong progress in this field, there are still challenging situations in which established methods fail. We present an approach to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of established visual localization methods by adding rendered images. In detail, we first use a modern visual SLAM approach that provides a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based map to create reference data. We demonstrate that enriching reference data with images rendered from 3DGS at randomly sampled poses significantly improves the performance of both geometry-based visual localization and Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods. Through comprehensive evaluation in a large industrial environment, we analyze the performance impact of incorporating these additional rendered views.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[Hybrid Explicit Representation for Ultra-Realistic Head Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453v2)**<details>We introduce a novel approach to creating ultra-realistic head avatars and rendering them in real-time (>30fps at $2048 \times 1334$ resolution). First, we propose a hybrid explicit representation that combines the advantages of two primitive-based efficient rendering techniques. UV-mapped 3D mesh is utilized to capture sharp and rich textures on smooth surfaces, while 3D Gaussian Splatting is employed to represent complex geometric structures. In the pipeline of modeling an avatar, after tracking parametric models based on captured multi-view RGB videos, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the texture and opacity map of mesh, as well as a set of 3D Gaussian splats localized and rigged onto the mesh facets. Specifically, we perform $\alpha$-blending on the color and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffer from the rasterization results of mesh and 3DGS. This process involves the mesh and 3DGS adaptively fitting the captured visual information to outline a high-fidelity digital avatar. To avoid artifacts caused by Gaussian splats crossing the mesh facets, we design a stable hybrid depth sorting strategy. Experiments illustrate that our modeled results exceed those of state-of-the-art approaches.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>16 pag</details> |
| **[WRF-GS: Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04832v2)**<details>Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.</details> | 2025-02-19 | <details>ccepted to the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2025)</details> |
| **[GlossGau: Efficient Inverse Rendering for Glossy Surface with Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14129v1)**<details>The reconstruction of 3D objects from calibrated photographs represents a fundamental yet intricate challenge in the domains of computer graphics and vision. Although neural reconstruction approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable capabilities, their processing costs remain substantial. Recently, the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) largely improves the training efficiency and facilitates to generate realistic rendering in real-time. However, due to the limited ability of Spherical Harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information, 3D-GS falls short in reconstructing glossy objects. Researchers have turned to enhance the specular expressiveness of 3D-GS through inverse rendering. Yet these methods often struggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the benefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce GlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes with glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable to vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as incident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the per-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We utilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply regularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge encountered in related works. Experiments demonstrate that GlossGau achieves competitive or superior reconstruction on datasets with glossy surfaces. Compared with previous GS-based works that address the specular surface, our optimization time is considerably less.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[Inter3D: A Benchmark and Strong Baseline for Human-Interactive 3D Object Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14004v1)**<details>Recent advancements in implicit 3D reconstruction methods, e.g., neural rendering fields and Gaussian splatting, have primarily focused on novel view synthesis of static or dynamic objects with continuous motion states. However, these approaches struggle to efficiently model a human-interactive object with n movable parts, requiring 2^n separate models to represent all discrete states. To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts. In addition, we explore two occupancy grid sampling strategies to facilitate training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark, showcasing the challenges of the task and the superiority of our approach.</details> | 2025-02-19 |  |
| **[GARAD-SLAM: 3D GAussian splatting for Real-time Anti Dynamic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03228v2)**<details>The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM system has garnered widespread attention due to its excellent performance in real-time high-fidelity rendering. However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</details> | 2025-02-18 | <details>The paper was accepted by ICRA 2025</details> |
| **[GS-QA: Comprehensive Quality Assessment Benchmark for Gaussian Splatting View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13196v1)**<details>Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a promising alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for real-time 3D scene rendering. Using a set of 3D Gaussians to represent complex geometry and appearance, GS achieves faster rendering times and reduced memory consumption compared to the neural network approach used in NeRF. However, quality assessment of GS-generated static content is not yet explored in-depth. This paper describes a subjective quality assessment study that aims to evaluate synthesized videos obtained with several static GS state-of-the-art methods. The methods were applied to diverse visual scenes, covering both 360-degree and forward-facing (FF) camera trajectories. Moreover, the performance of 18 objective quality metrics was analyzed using the scores resulting from the subjective study, providing insights into their strengths, limitations, and alignment with human perception. All videos and scores are made available providing a comprehensive database that can be used as benchmark on GS view synthesis and objective quality metrics.</details> | 2025-02-18 |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11801v1)**<details>When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
| **[Exploring the Versal AI Engine for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11782v1)**<details>Dataflow-oriented spatial architectures are the emerging paradigm for higher computation performance and efficiency. AMD Versal AI Engine is a commercial spatial architecture consisting of tiles of VLIW processors supporting SIMD operations arranged in a two-dimensional mesh. The architecture requires the explicit design of task assignments and dataflow configurations for each tile to maximize performance, demanding advanced techniques and meticulous design. However, a few works revealed the performance characteristics of the Versal AI Engine through practical workloads. In this work, we provide the comprehensive performance evaluation of the Versal AI Engine using Gaussian feature computation in 3D Gaussian splatting as a practical workload, and we then propose a novel dedicated algorithm to fully exploit the hardware architecture. The computations of 3D Gaussian splatting include matrix multiplications and color computations utilizing high-dimensional spherical harmonic coefficients. These tasks are processed efficiently by leveraging the SIMD capabilities and their instruction-level parallelism. Additionally, pipelined processing is achieved by assigning different tasks to individual cores, thereby fully exploiting the spatial parallelism of AI Engines. The proposed method demonstrated a 226-fold throughput increase in simulation-based evaluation, outperforming a naive approach. These findings provide valuable insights for application development that effectively harnesses the spatial and architectural advantages of AI Engines.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
| **[GaussianMotion: End-to-End Learning of Animatable Gaussian Avatars with Pose Guidance from Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11642v1)**<details>In this paper, we introduce GaussianMotion, a novel human rendering model that generates fully animatable scenes aligned with textual descriptions using Gaussian Splatting. Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>8 pag</details> |
| **[3D Reconstruction of Shoes for Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18643v2)**<details>This paper introduces a mobile-based solution that enhances online shoe shopping through 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR), leveraging the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Addressing the limitations of static 2D images, the framework generates realistic 3D shoe models from 2D images, achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32, and enables immersive AR interactions via smartphones. A custom shoe segmentation dataset of 3120 images was created, with the best-performing segmentation model achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.95. This paper demonstrates the potential of 3D modeling and AR to revolutionize online shopping by offering realistic virtual interactions, with applicability across broader fashion categories.</details> | 2025-02-17 |  |
| **[PUGS: Zero-shot Physical Understanding with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12231v1)**<details>Current robotic systems can understand the categories and poses of objects well. But understanding physical properties like mass, friction, and hardness, in the wild, remains challenging. We propose a new method that reconstructs 3D objects using the Gaussian splatting representation and predicts various physical properties in a zero-shot manner. We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation. Our framework is named as zero-shot physical understanding with Gaussian splatting, or PUGS. PUGS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the standard benchmark of ABO-500 mass prediction. We provide extensive quantitative ablations and qualitative visualization to demonstrate the mechanism of our designs. We show the proposed methodology can help address challenging real-world grasping tasks. Our codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/EverNorif/PUGS</details> | 2025-02-17 | <details>ICRA 2025, Project page: https://evernorif.github.io/PUGS</details> |
| **[OMG: Opacity Matters in Material Modeling with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10988v1)**<details>Decomposing geometry, materials and lighting from a set of images, namely inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.</details> | 2025-02-16 | <details>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</details> |
| **[GS-GVINS: A Tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System Augmented by 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10975v1)**<details>Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</details> | 2025-02-16 |  |
| **[E-3DGS: Event-Based Novel View Rendering of Large-Scale Scenes Using 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10827v1)**<details>Novel view synthesis techniques predominantly utilize RGB cameras, inheriting their limitations such as the need for sufficient lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and restricted dynamic range. In contrast, event cameras are significantly more resilient to these limitations but have been less explored in this domain, particularly in large-scale settings. Current methodologies primarily focus on front-facing or object-oriented (360-degree view) scenarios. For the first time, we introduce 3D Gaussians for event-based novel view synthesis. Our method reconstructs large and unbounded scenes with high visual quality. We contribute the first real and synthetic event datasets tailored for this setting. Our method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms the baseline EventNeRF by a margin of 11-25% in PSNR (dB) while being orders of magnitude faster in reconstruction and rendering.</details> | 2025-02-15 | <details>15 pages, 10 figures and 3 tables; project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/E3DGS/; International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV) 2025</details> |

However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

| **[Self-Calibrating Gaussian Splatting for Large Field of View Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09563v1)**<details>In this paper, we present a self-calibrating framework that jointly optimizes camera parameters, lens distortion and 3D Gaussian representations, enabling accurate and efficient scene reconstruction. In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</details> | 2025-02-13 | <details>Project Page: https://denghilbert.github.io/self-c</details> |
| **[4-LEGS: 4D Language Embedded Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10719v3)**<details>The emergence of neural representations has revolutionized our means for digitally viewing a wide range of 3D scenes, enabling the synthesis of photorealistic images rendered from novel views. Recently, several techniques have been proposed for connecting these low-level representations with the high-level semantics understanding embodied within the scene. These methods elevate the rich semantic understanding from 2D imagery to 3D representations, distilling high-dimensional spatial features onto 3D space. In our work, we are interested in connecting language with a dynamic modeling of the world. We show how to lift spatio-temporal features to a 4D representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables an interactive interface where the user can spatiotemporally localize events in the video from text prompts. We demonstrate our system on public 3D video datasets of people and animals performing various actions.</details> | 2025-02-13 | <details>Eurographics 2025.

| **[Gaussian-Det: Learning Closed-Surface Gaussians for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404v2)**<details>Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement.

However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</details> | 2025-02-13 |  |

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present \textbf{L}arge \textbf{I}mages are \textbf{G}aussians (\textbf{LIG}), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details. Consequently, we successfully represent large images as Gaussian points and achieve high-quality large image representation, demonstrating its efficacy across various types of large images.

To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and uses world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods.

Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</details> | 2025-02-13 |  |

Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D imag</details> | 2025-02-12 |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591v3)**<details>While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</details> | 2025-02-12 |  |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v3)**<details>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Interactive Holographic Visualization for 3D Facial Avatar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08085v1)**<details>Traditional methods for visualizing dynamic human expressions, particularly in medical training, often rely on flat-screen displays or static mannequins, which have proven inefficient for realistic simulation. In response, we propose a platform that leverages a 3D interactive facial avatar capable of displaying non-verbal feedback, including pain signals. This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint. By incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and real-time view-dependent calibration, we significantly improve the training environment for accurate pain recognition and assessment.</details> | 2025-02-12 |  |
| **[UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846v2)**<details>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</details> | 2025-02-11 | <details>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvg</details> |

GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

| **[EdgeGaussians -- 3D Edge Mapping via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12886v2)**<details>With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), preserving the accurate mesh extraction ability of 2D primitives. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.</details> | 2025-02-11 |  |

However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in in- complete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transpar- ent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle.

However, most existing methods prioritize appearance consistency while neglecting underlying physical principles, leading to artifacts such as unrealistic deformations, unstable dynamics, and implausible objects interactions. Incorporating physics priors into generative models has become a crucial research direction to enhance structural integrity and motion realism. This survey provides a review of physics-aware generative methods, systematically analyzing how physical constraints are integrated into 3D and 4D generation.

Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of major methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different materials and motion dynamics.

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</details> | 2025-02-09 | <details>14 pages, 8 figur</details> |
| **[DEGAS: Detailed Expressions on Full-Body Gaussian Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588v2)**<details>Although neural rendering has made significant advances in creating lifelike, animatable full-body and head avatars, incorporating detailed expressions into full-body avatars remains largely unexplored. We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</details> | 2025-02-08 | <details>3DV 2025</details> |

Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for testing and validating the autonomous flight of shipboard UAVs, specifically focusing on vision-based control and estimation algorithms.</details> | 2025-02-08 | <details>8 pages, 15 figures, conferenc</details> |

| **[Drag Your Gaussian: Effective Drag-Based Editing with Score Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18672v2)**<details>Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| **[GaussRender: Learning 3D Occupancy with Gaussian Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05040v1)**<details>Understanding the 3D geometry and semantics of driving scenes is critical for developing of safe autonomous vehicles. While 3D occupancy models are typically trained using voxel-based supervision with standard losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Lovasz, dice), these approaches treat voxel predictions independently, neglecting their spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a plug-and-play 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that enhances voxel-based supervision. Our method projects 3D voxel representations into arbitrary 2D perspectives and leverages Gaussian splatting as an efficient, differentiable rendering proxy of voxels, introducing spatial dependencies across projected elements. This approach improves semantic and geometric consistency, handles occlusions more efficiently, and requires no architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate consistent performance gains across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), highlighting the robustness and versatility of our framework.

| **[HAC++: Towards 100X Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12255v3)**<details>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

While prior works have approached this as a perception prediction problem, we formulate it as scene-aware 3D occupancy reconstruction with geometry and semantics. In this work, we propose OccGS, a novel 3D Occupancy reconstruction framework utilizing Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussian Splatting in a zero-shot manner. Leveraging semantics extracted from vision-language models and geometry guided by LiDAR points, OccGS constructs Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussians from raw multisensor data. We also develop a cumulative Gaussian-to-3D voxel splatting method for reconstructing occupancy from the Gaussians. OccGS performs favorably against self-supervised methods in occupancy prediction, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot semantic 3D occupancy estimation.</details> | 2025-02-07 |  |
| **[PoI: Pixel of Interest for Novel View Synthesis Assisted Scene Coordinate Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04843v1)**<details>The task of estimating camera poses can be enhanced through novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to increase the diversity and extension of training data. However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.</details> | 2025-02-07 |  |

However, traditional radiance field methods do not address the specific challenges inherent to 360-degree images. We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations. The noticeable performance gain in the real-world dataset captured by consumer-grade omnidirectional cameras verifies the effectiveness of our general omnidirectional camera model in reducing the distortion of 360-degree images.</details> | 2025-02-07 | <details>Accepted to ICLR 2025, Project Page: http://www.chenyingshu.com/sc-omnig</details> |

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.</details> | 2025-02-07 |  |

We introduce a novel method that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit surface representation, enabling intuitive editing of recovered scenes through mesh manipulation. Starting with a set of input images and camera poses, our approach reconstructs the scene surface using a neural signed distance field. This neural surface acts as a geometric prior guiding the training of Gaussian Splatting components, ensuring their alignment with the scene geometry. To facilitate editing, we encode the visual and geometric information into a lightweight triangle soup proxy. Edits applied to the mesh extracted from the neural surface propagate seamlessly through this intermediate structure to update the recovered appearance. Unlike previous methods relying on the triangle soup proxy representation, our approach supports a wider range of modifications and fully leverages the mesh topology, enabling a more flexible and intuitive editing process.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework Gaussian Processes Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), where a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to achieve adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. The densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians to enhance reconstruction performance.

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</details> | 2025-02-05 |  |

Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods. As one of the first methods addressing promptable segmentation in 3D-GS, the simplicity and effectiveness of SAGA pave the way for future advancements in this field.

This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation.

However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds.

| **[GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11625v3)**<details>In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</details> | 2025-02-04 |  |

To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.</details> | 2025-02-03 | <details>Accepted for ICLR 2025</details> |

Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts. Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning.

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</details> | 2025-02-03 |  |
| **[UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846v1)**<details>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</details> | 2025-02-03 | <details>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvg</details> |

We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</details> | 2025-02-03 |  |
| **[VR-Robo: A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework for Visual Robot Navigation and Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01536v1)**<details>Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</details> | 2025-02-03 | <details>Project Page: https://vr-robo.github.io</details> |
| **[Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157v1)**<details>Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.</details> | 2025-02-03 |  |
| **[Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619v3)**<details>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</details> | 2025-02-02 |  |

| **[EmoTalkingGaussian: Continuous Emotion-conditioned Talking Head Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00654v1)**<details>3D Gaussian splatting-based talking head synthesis has recently gained attention for its ability to render high-fidelity images with real-time inference speed. However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.</details> | 2025-02-02 | <details>22 pag</details> |
| **[Gaussians on their Way: Wasserstein-Constrained 4D Gaussian Splatting with State-Space Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00333v3)**<details>Dynamic scene rendering has taken a leap forward with the rise of 4D Gaussian Splatting, but there's still one elusive challenge: how to make 3D Gaussians move through time as naturally as they would in the real world, all while keeping the motion smooth and consistent. In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.</details> | 2025-02-01 |  |
| **[Gaussian Splatting Visual MPC for Granular Media Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09740v2)**<details>Recent advancements in learned 3D representations have enabled significant progress in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks, particularly for rigid-body objects. However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</details> | 2025-02-01 | <details>project website https://weichengtseng.github.io/gs-granular-man</details> |
